Qt 5.12.1 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 5.12.0.

For more details, refer to the online documentation included in this
distribution. The documentation is also available online:

http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/index.html

Note: Tech Preview modules are able to change APIs to refine or enhance the
module's functionality.  Thus Qt's binary compatibility quarantees aren't
applicable.  Code switching to 5.12 (when Remote Objects "graduated" from
Tech Preview) from earlier versions of Qt Remote Objects will need to be
recompiled.
