Qt 5.13.2 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 5.13.0 through 5.13.1.

For more details, refer to the online documentation included in this
distribution. The documentation is also available online:

https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/index.html

The Qt version 5.13 series is binary compatible with the 5.12.x series.
Applications compiled for 5.12 will continue to run with 5.13 under most
conditions.  There may be exceptions if you are using Qt Remote Objects
between proesses or devices running different versions Qt.  The different
versions of Qt must be running compatible versions of QtRO's protocol.

Changes to the Qt Remote Objects protocol are documented online:

https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtremoteobjects-compatibility.html

The QtRO protocol has been updated in Qt 5.12.4 and Qt 5.13.0 to 1.3.
