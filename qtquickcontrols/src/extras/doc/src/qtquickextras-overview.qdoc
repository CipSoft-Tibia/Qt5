    \title Qt Quick Extras Overview
    \brief A set of UI controls to create user interfaces in Qt Quick

    Qt Quick Extras provide a set of UI controls to create user
    interfaces in Qt Quick.

    \section1 Getting Started

    \section2 Building

    If you are building Qt Quick Extras from source, you can follow
    the steps used for most Qt modules:

    \code
    qmake
    make
    make install
    \endcode

    \section2 Using the Controls

    The QML types can be imported into your application using the following
    import statement in your \c {.qml} file.

    \code
    import QtQuick.Extras 1.4
    \endcode

    \section1 Interactive controls

    \annotatedlist extras-interactive

    \section1 Non-interactive controls

    \annotatedlist extras-non-interactive

    \section1 Creating a basic example

    A basic example of a QML file that makes use of controls is shown here:

    \code
    import QtQuick 2.2
    import QtQuick.Extras 1.4

    Rectangle {
        DelayButton {
            anchors.centerIn: parent
        }
    }
    \endcode

    For an interactive showcase of the controls provided by
    \l{Qt Quick Extras}, you can look at
    the \l{Qt Quick Extras - Gallery}{Gallery} example.
