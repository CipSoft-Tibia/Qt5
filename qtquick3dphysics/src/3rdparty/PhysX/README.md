# PhysX

This is the PhysX project used by Qt Quick 3D Physics. This is just a copy-paste of relevant source files from https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX with an added CMake project.
It is using a clean checkout of version 4.1 with some minor patches applied and stored as .patch files in this directory for reference.

The sources for the CMakeLists.txt are generated by running find_includes.py
