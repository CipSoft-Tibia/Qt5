   \title Qt Speech
   \brief The Qt Speech module enables access to text-to-speech engines

   The module enables a Qt application to support accessibility features such
   as text-to-speech, which is useful for end-users who are visually
   challenged or cannot access the application for whatever reason. The
   most common use case where text-to-speech comes in handy is when the
   end-user is driving and cannot attend the incoming messages on the phone.
   In such a scenario, the messaging application can read out the incoming
   message.

   The module depends on Speech Dispatcher (libspeechd) on the Linux platform.
   On other platforms, it uses the native APIs to access the
   platform-specific text-to-speech engines.

   \section1 Getting Started

   To include the definitions of the module's classes and functions, use the
   following directive:

   \code
   #include <QTextToSpeech>
   \endcode

   To link against the module, add this line to your qmake \c .pro file:

   \badcode
   QT += texttospeech
   \endcode
