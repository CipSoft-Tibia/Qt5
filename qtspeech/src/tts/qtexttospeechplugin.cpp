    \brief The QTextToSpeechPlugin class is the base for all text-to-speech plug-ins.
    \internal

    A plug-in implementation should derive from QTextToSpeechPlugin and re-implement
    \l createTextToSpeechEngine().
*/

/*!
    Factory method that is triggered by a call to \l QTextToSpeech::QTextToSpeech()
    when a provider name is given in the constructor and a text-to-speech plug-in
    matching the provider name was successfully loaded.

    Value of \a parameters is currently always empty.

    If an error occurs, the method should return 0 and (optionally) give a description
    of the error in \a errorString. In this case, QTextToSpeech::state() will return
    QTextToSpeech::Error.

    If \a parent is 0, the caller takes the ownership of the returned engine instance.
