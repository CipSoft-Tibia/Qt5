    \title Qt 3D: Scene3D QML with Widgets Example
    \ingroup qt3d-examples-qml
    \brief A QWidget-based application with a QML scene containing a 3D scene.

    \image widgets-scene3d.png

    \e {widgets-scene3D} demonstrates visualizing a 3D scene from a
    QWidget-based application using QQuickWidget.

    The actual 3D scene is the same as in the \e {scene3d} example.

    This approach is different from the one based on
    QWidget::createWindowContainer() demonstrated in \e {basicshapes-cpp}
    because it does not create a native window for the Qt 3D content. Rather,
    it uses QQuickWidget, a genuine QWidget subclass to compose the Qt Quick
    and Qt 3D content together with the traditional widgets.

    \note Be aware of the performance implications. While this approach is very
    flexible in the sense that it allows mixing QML and Qt 3D with widgets
    without clipping or stacking issues, using Scene3D in a QQuickWidget
    involves rendering to offscreen render targets (via framebuffer objects)
    twice. This is not always desirable for more complex scenes. For those the
    native window based approach shown in \e {basicshapes-cpp} will likely be a
    better choice.
