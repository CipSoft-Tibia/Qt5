    \title Qt 3D

    Qt 3D provides functionality for near-realtime simulation systems
    with support for 2D and 3D rendering in both Qt C++ and Qt Quick
    applications.

    The functionality in Qt 3D is divided into the following C++ modules:

    \annotatedlist qt3d-modules

    The following C++ modules are in still development but are available
    as technology previews:

    \annotatedlist qt3d-modules-preliminary

    For Qt Quick applications, Qt 3D provides the following QML modules:

    \annotatedlist qt3d-qmlmodules

    The following QML modules are in still development but are available
    as technology previews:

    \annotatedlist qt3d-qmlmodules-preliminary

    \section1 Using the Module

    For a C++ application that performs 2D or 3D rendering, collision detection,
    and handles user input, include the following directives of the modules'
    classes:

    \code
    #include <Qt3DCore>
    #include <Qt3DRender>
    #include <Qt3DInput>
    #include <Qt3DLogic>
    #include <Qt3DExtras>
    #include <Qt3DAnimation>
    \endcode

    To import the QML types into your application, use the following import
    statement in your .qml file:

    \qml
    import Qt3D.Core
    import Qt3D.Render
    import Qt3D.Input
    import Qt3D.Logic
    import Qt3D.Extras
    import Qt3D.Animation
    import QtQuick.Scene2D
    import QtQuick.Scene3D
    \endqml

    \include {module-use.qdocinc} {using the c++ api}

    \section1 Overview

    The high level design and motivation for Qt 3D is described in the \l {Qt 3D
    Overview}. The Qt 3D Render offers support for data-driven configuration as
    described in \l {Qt 3D Render Framegraph}.
