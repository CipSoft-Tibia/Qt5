    \brief Enable alpha-to-coverage multisampling mode.

    A Qt3DRender::QAlphaCoverage class enables alpha-to-coverage multisampling mode.
    When enabled, the fragment alpha value is used as a coverage for the sample
    and combined with fragment coverage value. Qt3DRender::QAlphaCoverage does
    nothing if multisampling is disabled. Alpha-to-coverage is most useful when
    order independent blending is required, for example when rendering leaves,
    grass and other rich vegetation.

    It can be added to a QRenderPass by calling QRenderPass::addRenderState():

    \code
    QRenderPass *renderPass = new QRenderPass();

    // Create a alpha coverage render state
    QAlphaCoverage *alphaCoverage = new QAlphaCoverage();
    QMultiSampleAntiAliasing *multiSampleAntialiasing = new QMultiSampleAntiAliasing();

    // Add the render states to the render pass
    renderPass->addRenderState(alphaCoverage);
    renderPass->addRenderState(multiSampleAntialiasing);
    \endcode

    Or to a QRenderStateSet by calling QRenderStateSet::addRenderState():

    \code
    QRenderStateSet *renderStateSet = new QRenderStateSet();

    // Create a alpha coverage render state
    QAlphaCoverage *alphaCoverage = new QAlphaCoverage();
    QMultiSampleAntiAliasing *multiSampleAntialiasing = new QMultiSampleAntiAliasing();

    // Add the render states to the render state set
    renderStateSet->addRenderState(alphaCoverage);
    renderStateSet->addRenderState(multiSampleAntialiasing);
