    \brief The QPickingSettings class specifies how entity picking is handled.

    \inmodule Qt3DRender
    \inherits Qt3DCore::QNode

    The picking settings determine how the entity picking is handled. For more details about
    entity picking, see QObjectPicker and QRayCaster component documentation.

    When using QObjectPicker components, picking is triggered by mouse events.

    When using QRayCaster or QScreenRayCaster components, picking can be explicitly triggered by
    the application.

    In both cases, a ray will be cast through the scene to find geometry intersecting the ray.
