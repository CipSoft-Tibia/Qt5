    \since 5.7
    \brief QAbstractFunctor is an abstract base class for all functors.

    The QAbstractFunctor is used as a base class for all functors and data
    generators in Qt3DRender module.

    When user defines a new functor or generator, they need to implement the
    \l QAbstractFunctor::id() method, which should be done using the \c {QT3D_FUNCTOR}
    macro in the class definition.
 */
/*!
    \fn qintptr Qt3DRender::QAbstractFunctor::id() const
 */
/*!
    \macro QT3D_FUNCTOR(Class)
    \relates Qt3DRender::QAbstractFunctor

    This macro assigns functor id to the \a Class, which is used by QAbstractFunctor::functor_cast
    to determine if the cast can be done.
 */

/*!
    \fn template<class T> const T * Qt3DRender::QAbstractFunctor::functor_cast(const QAbstractFunctor *other) const

    This method is used to cast functor \a other to type T if the other is of
    type T (or of subclass); otherwise returns 0. This method works similarly
    to \l [QtCore] {qobject_cast(const QObject *object)}{qobject_cast()},
    except with functors derived from QAbstractFunctor.

    \warning If T was not declared with \l QT3D_FUNCTOR macro, then the results are undefined.
