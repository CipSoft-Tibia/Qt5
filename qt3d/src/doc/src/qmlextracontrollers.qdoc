    \qmltype FirstPersonCameraController
    \inqmlmodule Qt3D.Extras
    \brief The FirstPersonCameraController allows controlling the scene camera
    from the first person perspective.
    \since 5.7
    \inherits Qt3D.Core::Entity

    The FirstPersonCameraController allows controlling the scene camera from the first person
    perspective.

    The controls are:
    \table
    \header
        \li Input
        \li Action
    \row
        \li Left mouse button
        \li While the left mouse button is pressed, mouse movement along x-axis pans the camera and
        movement along y-axis tilts it.
    \row
        \li Shift key
        \li Turns the fine motion control active while pressed. Makes mouse pan and tilt less
        sensitive.
    \row
        \li Arrow keys
        \li Move the camera horizontally relative to camera viewport.
    \row
        \li Page up and page down keys
        \li Move the camera vertically relative to camera viewport.
    \endtable
*/
/*!
    \qmlproperty Camera FirstPersonCameraController::camera

    Holds the currently controlled camera.
*/
/*!
    \qmlproperty real FirstPersonCameraController::linearSpeed

    Holds the current linear speed of the camera controller. Linear speed determines the
    movement speed of the camera.
*/
/*!
    \qmlproperty real FirstPersonCameraController::lookSpeed

    Holds the current look speed of the camera controller. The look speed determines the turn rate
    of the camera pan and tilt.
*/
/*!
    \qmlproperty real FirstPersonCameraController::acceleration

    Holds the current acceleration.
    Specifies the rate at which the camera linear speed increases when a key is held.
    If the acceleration is negative, the linear speed stays constant.
    Defaults to -1.0.
*/
/*!
    \qmlproperty real FirstPersonCameraController::deceleration

    Specifies the rate at which the camera linear speed decreases when a key is released.
    If the deceleration is negative, the linear speed stays constant.
    Defaults to -1.0.

    \qmltype OrbitCameraController
    \inqmlmodule Qt3D.Extras
    \brief The OrbitCameraController class allows controlling the scene camera along orbital path.
    \since 5.7
    \inherits Qt3D.Core::Entity

    The OrbitCameraController class allows controlling the scene camera along orbital path.

    The controls are:
    \table
    \header
        \li Input
        \li Action
    \row
        \li Left mouse button
        \li While the left mouse button is pressed, mouse movement along x-axis moves the camera
        left and right and movement along y-axis moves it up and down.
    \row
        \li Right mouse button
        \li While the right mouse button is pressed, mouse movement along x-axis pans the camera
        around the camera view center and movement along y-axis tilts it around the camera
        view center.
    \row
        \li Both left and right mouse button
        \li While both the left and the right mouse button are pressed, mouse movement along y-axis
        zooms the camera in and out without changing the view center.
    \row
        \li Arrow keys
        \li Move the camera vertically and horizontally relative to camera viewport.
    \row
        \li Page up and page down keys
        \li Move the camera forwards and backwards.
    \row
        \li Shift key
        \li Changes the behavior of the up and down arrow keys to zoom the camera in and out
        without changing the view center. The other movement keys are disabled.
    \row
        \li Alt key
        \li Changes the behovior of the arrow keys to pan and tilt the camera around the view
        center. Disables the page up and page down keys.
