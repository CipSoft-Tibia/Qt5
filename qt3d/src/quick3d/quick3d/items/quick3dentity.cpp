    \brief Entity is a \l Node subclass that can aggregate several
    \l Component3D instances that will specify its behavior.

    By itself a Entity is an empty shell. The behavior of a Entity
    object is defined by the \l Component3D objects it references. Each Qt3D
    backend aspect will be able to interpret and process an Entity by
    recognizing which components it is made up of. One aspect may decide to only
    process entities composed of a single \l Transform component whilst
    another may focus on \l MouseHandler.
