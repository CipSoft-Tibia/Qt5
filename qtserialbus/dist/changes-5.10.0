QtSerialBus
-----------

 - QCanBusFrame
   * Added local echo flag to mark all echo frames that are generated by the
     hardware on successful transmission to CAN bus as such.

 - PeakCAN:
   * [QTBUG-63428] Fixed that connect() always returned false
     under Linux.
   * Peak status frames are no longer wrongly converted into
     QCanBusFrame::DataFrame, they are simply dropped for now.
     In a later Qt version they might be converted into proper
     QCanBusFrame::ErrorFrame, together with an interpretErrorFrame()
     implementation.

 - SystecCAN:
   * [QTBUG-63833] Fixed that availableDevices() could return
     wrong device numbers.
   * Fixed that availableDevices() did only return the first two
     channels of the first device.

 - [QTBUG-62421] Fixed the address counter for received Modbus register
   entries in the Modbus Master Example.
 - [QTBUG-62144] [QTBUG-62299] Fixed a crash due to unexpected state in
   Modbus process queued element.

 - [QTBUG-60651] Completely revamped the CAN Example

 - [QTBUG-61970] Set proper description for canbusutil on Windows

 - Minor documentation improvements

   through the module
