****************************************************************************
*                            Qt 5.11.0 Changes                             *
****************************************************************************

CAN bus
-------

 - Introduced categorized logging to the module which can be enabled
   by the "qt.canbus" and "qt.canbus.plugins.<pluginname>" filters.

 - Added description, serial number and channel to QCanBusDeviceInfo, as
   far as supported by the various plugins.

 - [QTBUG-63294] QCanBusFrame::isValid() now checks for invalid CAN FD
   payload lengths. E.g. 24 is a valid CAN FD payload length, but 28
   is not. Frames with invalid data field size may therefore be discarded
   by QCanBusDevice::writeFrame() as it is impossible to transmit them on
   a real CAN bus.

 - All CAN bus plugins that don't support CAN FD now also discard CAN FD
   frames with payload length <= 8.

 - Added a J2534 Pass-Thru CAN bus plugin.

 - [QTBUG-67030] Fixed a receive problem in the VectorCAN plugin. When
   multiple channels were open, only the first one could receive frames.

MOD bus
------

 - [QTBUG-66648] Ensure that QModbusDevice::close() handles being already
   unconnected. Before, an unconnected device could hang in closing state
   forever.
