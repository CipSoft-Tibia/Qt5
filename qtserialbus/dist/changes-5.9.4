*                               Qt 5.9.4 Changes                           *

QtSerialBus
------

 - SocketCAN
   * [QTBUG-64406] Fixed compiling the SocketCAN plugin with older Kernels
     without support for CAN FD bitrate switch and error state indicator.

 - TinyCAN
   * [QTBUG-65474] Fixed compiliation with MSVC 2013
   * The function availableDevices() now returns {"can0.0"} instead
     {"can0.0", "can0.1"} for the TinyCAN plugin. This value is
     hardcoded for now as available devices cannot be detected.
     The function will be changed in later Qt versions to return the
     correct values once QTBUG-62958 is solved.
