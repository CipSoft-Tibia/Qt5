    \title Qt Quick Templates 2 QML Types
    \ingroup qmlmodules
    \brief Provides QML types for templates (Qt Quick Templates).

    The \l {Qt Quick Templates 2} module provides a set of non-visual templates
    that can be used to build user interface controls in QML using \l {Qt Quick}.

    The QML types can be imported using the following import statement in your
    \c .qml file:

    \badcode
    import QtQuick.Templates 2.12 as T
    \endcode

    For the sake of clarity, there is a one-to-one mapping between the types
    provided by the \c QtQuick.Templates and \c QtQuick.Controls imports. For
    every type available in the \c QtQuick.Controls import, a non-visual template
    type by the same name exists in the \c QtQuick.Templates import.

    \note It is recommended to use a namespace for the templates import to avoid
    overlap with the types provided by the \c QtQuick.Controls import.
