    \title Default Style

    The Default style is a basic all-round style.

    The Default style is a simple and light-weight style that offers the maximum
    performance for Qt Quick Controls 2. It is built with a minimal amount of Qt
    Quick primitives, and keeps animations and transitions to the minimum.

    \image qtquickcontrols2-default.png

    The style is selected by default when running Qt Quick Controls 2 applications.
    It is built into the module's resources, so by default it is shipped with
    any application that depends on the Qt Quick Controls 2 module

    \note The Default style is used as a fallback for other styles. If a style
    does not implement a certain control, the Default style implementation of
    that control is selected.
