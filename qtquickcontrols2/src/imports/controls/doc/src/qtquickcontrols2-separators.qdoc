    \brief Guidelines for separator controls

    Qt Quick Controls 2 offers a selection of separators.

    \annotatedlist qtquickcontrols2-separators

    Each type of separator has its own specific use case. The following
    sections offer guidelines for choosing the appropriate type of separator,
    depending on the use case.

    \section1 MenuSeparator Control

    \image qtquickcontrols2-menuseparator.png

    \l MenuSeparator should be used to separate items (typically MenuItem
    controls) in a Menu. Grouping related menu items together makes it easier
    for the user to interact with the menu. For example, a typical desktop
    user interface might have \c Undo and \c Redo items in one group, and
    \c Cut, \c Copy and \c Paste in another.

    \section1 ToolSeparator Control

    \l ToolSeparator should be used to separate items (typically ToolButton
    controls) in a ToolBar. It can be used in horizontal or vertical toolbars.
