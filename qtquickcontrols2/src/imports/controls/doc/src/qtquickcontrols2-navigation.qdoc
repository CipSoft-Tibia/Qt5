    \brief Guidelines for navigation controls

    Qt Quick Controls offers a selection of navigation models.

    \annotatedlist qtquickcontrols2-navigation

    The following sections offer guidelines for choosing the appropriate type
    of navigation model, depending on the use case.

    \section1 StackView Control

    \l StackView provides a stack-based navigation model which can be used
    with a set of interlinked pages. StackView works according to a last-in
    first-out principle: the page pushed last on the stack is the one visible.
    Popping a page removes the last page and makes the previous one visible.

    \section1 SwipeView Control

    \l SwipeView provides a navigation model that simplifies horizontal paged
    scrolling. The page indicator on the bottom shows which is the presently
    active page.

    \section1 TabBar Control

    between different subtasks, views, or modes.

    \section1 TabButton Control
