    \brief Indicates background activity, for example, while content is being loaded.

    \image qtquickcontrols2-busyindicator.gif

    The busy indicator should be used to indicate activity while content is
    being loaded or the UI is blocked waiting for a resource to become available.

    The following snippet shows how to use the BusyIndicator:

    \qml
    BusyIndicator {
        running: image.status === Image.Loading
    }
    \endqml

    BusyIndicator is similar to an indeterminate \l ProgressBar. Both can be
    used to indicate background activity. The main difference is visual, and
    that ProgressBar can also present a concrete amount of progress (when it
    can be determined). Due to the visual difference, busy indicators and
    indeterminate progress bars fit different places in user interfaces.
    Typical places for a busy indicator:
    \list
    \li in the corner of a \l ToolBar
    \li as an overlay on top of a \l Page
    \li on the side of an \l ItemDelegate
    \endlist
