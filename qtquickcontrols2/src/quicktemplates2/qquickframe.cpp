    \brief Visual frame for a logical group of controls.

    Frame is used to layout a logical group of controls together within a
    visual frame. Frame does not provide a layout of its own, but requires
    you to position its contents, for instance by creating a \l RowLayout
    or a \l ColumnLayout.

    Items declared as children of a Frame are automatically parented to the
    Frame's \l {Control::}{contentItem}. Items created dynamically need to be
    explicitly parented to the contentItem.

    If only a single item is used within a Frame, it will resize to fit the
    implicit size of its contained item. This makes it particularly suitable
    for use together with layouts.
