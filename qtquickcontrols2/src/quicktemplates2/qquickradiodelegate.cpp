    \brief Exclusive item delegate with a radio indicator that can be toggled on or off.

    \image qtquickcontrols2-radiodelegate.gif

    RadioDelegate presents an item delegate that can be toggled on (checked) or
    off (unchecked). Radio delegates are typically used to select one option
    from a set of options.

    RadioDelegate inherits its API from \l ItemDelegate, which is inherited
    from AbstractButton. For instance, you can set \l {AbstractButton::text}{text},
    and react to \l {AbstractButton::clicked}{clicks} using the AbstractButton
    API. The state of the radio delegate can be set with the
    \l {AbstractButton::}{checked} property.

    Radio delegates are \l {AbstractButton::autoExclusive}{auto-exclusive}
    by default. Only one delegate can be checked at any time amongst radio
    delegates that belong to the same parent item; checking another delegate
    automatically unchecks the previously checked one. For radio delegates
    that do not share a common parent, ButtonGroup can be used to manage
    exclusivity.

    \l RadioButton is similar to RadioDelegate, except that it is typically
    not used in views, but rather when there are only a few options, and often
    with the requirement that each button is uniquely identifiable.

    \code
    ButtonGroup {
        id: buttonGroup
    }

    ListView {
        model: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"]
        delegate: RadioDelegate {
            text: modelData
            checked: index == 0
            ButtonGroup.group: buttonGroup
        }
    }
    \endcode
