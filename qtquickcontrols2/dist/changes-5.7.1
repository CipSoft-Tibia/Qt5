****************************************************************************
*                   Important Behavior Changes                             *
****************************************************************************

 - AbstractButton, Control, and Container now calculate their implicit size
   based on the implicit size of the content item plus paddings, and the
   implicit size of the background item. This makes it convenient to implement
   custom controls and buttons, because the implicit size calculation for
   these abstract/non-visual base types works as expected out of the box, but
   may cause surprises if an application relies on the old behavior that a
   custom control does not have any implicit size by default.

 - Drawers have been changed to follow the same visibility rules than all
   other types of popups do. This means that drawers no longer stay visible
   at the window edge in order to intercept input events, because that caused
   severe conflicts in input handling and stacking order between multiple
   drawers and other popups.

 - Popups have been fixed to respect explicitly set width and height.
   Previously, explicitly set size was accidentally ignored when a popup had
   implicit size set.
