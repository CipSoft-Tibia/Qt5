# Historical Histogram Data

This page presents data captured from `base::ThreadPool` histograms at a given
point in time so it can be used in future design decisions.

All data is 28-day aggregation on Stable channel.

## Number of tasks between waits

Number of tasks between two waits by a foreground worker thread in a
browser/renderer process.

Histogram name: ThreadPool.NumTasksBetweenWaits.(Browser/Renderer).Foreground

## Number of tasks run while queueing

Number of tasks run by ThreadPool while task was queuing (from time task was
posted until time it was run). Recorded for dummy heartbeat tasks in the
*browser* process. The heartbeat recording avoids dependencies between this
report and other work in the system.

Histogram name: ThreadPool.NumTasksRunWhileQueuing.Browser.*
Date: September 2019
Values in tables below are percentiles.

Note: In *renderer* processes, on all platforms/priorities, 0 tasks are run
while queuing at 99.5th percentile.

### Chrome OS

For all priorities, 0 tasks are run while queueing at 99.5th percentile.

### Analysis

The number of tasks that run while a BEST_EFFORT task is queued is unexpectedly
low. We should explore creating threads less aggressively, at the expense of
keeping BEST_EFFORT tasks in the queue for a longer time. See
[Bug 906079](https://crbug.com/906079).
