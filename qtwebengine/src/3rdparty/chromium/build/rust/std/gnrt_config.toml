[libc]
# Requires:
# * cfg(libc_align) for new enough rustc, which is normally provided by build.rs
#   but we don't run build scripts for std crates.
# * cfg(libc_priv_mod_use) is required for the below to work properly.
# * cfg(libc_core_cvoid) to use the same ffi c_void definition as libcore.
#
# See https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/blob/master/build.rs
cfg = ['libc_align', 'libc_priv_mod_use', 'libc_core_cvoid']

[std]
# Requires:
# * cfg(backtrace_in_libstd) because it directly includes .rs files from the
#   backtrace code rather than including it as a dependency. backtrace's
#   implementation has special-purpose code to handle this.
# * STD_ENV_ARCH is referenced in architecture-dependent code. Note this is the
#   target arch, and as such `$rust_target_arch` is passed literally to GN. This
#   variable is set at build time in build/config/rust.gni
#
# See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/std/build.rs
cfg = ['backtrace_in_libstd']
env = ['STD_ENV_ARCH=$rust_target_arch']

[test]
# Requires:
# * CFG_DISABLE_UNSTABLE_FEATURES=0 to match how it's built by x.py.
env = ['CFG_DISABLE_UNSTABLE_FEATURES=0']
