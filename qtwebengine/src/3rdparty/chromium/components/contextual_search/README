The Contextual Search component provides renderer support for an overlay panel
with an API that peeks up from the bottom of the host page.

This component communicates via mojo from the renderer to the browser and vice
versa.

Eventually we may reuse some of this code for other overlay panels, including
DOM Distiller (which is currently in a separate component).
