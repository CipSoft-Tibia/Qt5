Unreleased:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added API for querying registered data sources and their capabilities.
    * Support malloc heap profiles from GLibc Linux using LD_PRELOAD.
  Trace Processor:
    *
  UI:
    * Flow events are now drawn as arrows for the currently selected slice.
    *


v7.0 - 2020-09-01:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added auto-reconnection to the SDK. Tracing::Initialize() now retries in
      the background, instead of failing, if the tracing service is unrechable.
    * Added support for recording cpuhp (CPU hotplug) ftrace events.
    * Fixed heap profiling unwinding on multi-ABI systems.
    * Fixed reporting of live objects in the native heap profiler when using
      --dump-at-max.
    * Fixed crash when writing trace events with field nesting level > 10.
  Trace Processor:
    * Added Python bindings, see
      https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/trace-processor#python-api .
    * Added ingestion for Chrome instant events and Chrome flow events.
    * Added ingestion for Android GPU memory events and sched_blocked_reason.
    * Added WebView power metric.
    * Added support for WSL1 where Async I/O is not available.
    * Improved detection of Android suspend/resume events.
  UI:
    * Added GPU memory recording controls and ingestion code. Requires a recent
      Android 12+ kernel.
    * Added details panel for flow events, showed when the user selects a slice
      involved in a flow (arrows in the UI are still being worked on).
    * Added instant events rendering.
    * Added Google Analytics.
    * Fixed I/O thread-states in 4.14 kernels to deal with the removal of
      wake-kill using sched_blocked_reason.
    * Fixed "Perfetto UI started debugging this browser" showing when opening
      the UI and the Chrome extension is installed.
  Misc:
    * Update language to comply with Android's inclusive language guidance.


v6.0 - 2020-08-01:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added ftrace thermal events.
    * Added support for custom allocators to the heap profiler. Allows
      developers to report memory allocations that are not done through malloc.
    * Added detailed timestamping of key tracing session events.
    * Added support for building tracing services on CrOS (system-wide tracing).
    * Fixed filtering out of stale ftrace data that predates the beginning of
      the tracing session.
  Trace Processor:
    * Improved profile symbolizer. PERFETTO_SYMBOLIZER_MODE=index discovers
      symbol files by build id rather than name.
    * Added screen-state Android metrics.
  UI:
    * Added 'Info and stats' page to debug data losses and trace stats.
    * Added full cmdline to process detail panel.
    * Improved performance of async tracks using quantized queries.
    * Improved performance of counter and slice tracks for long traces by
      pre-caching quantized track data.
    * Improved actionablility of crash dialog when the Wasm module OOMs.


v5.0 - 2020-07-01:
  Tracing service and probes:
    * Added gpu_mem_total ftrace event.
    * Added TrustZone (scm start/end) event.
    * Added protos for GPU memory tracking and updated render stages proto.
    * Added time_in_state probe for Android (CPU time broken down by frequency).

  Trace Processor:
    * Added ingestion of IRQ and SoftIRQ events.
    * Added ingestion of workqueue events. KAddr symbolization still missing.
    * Added ingestion of voltage regulators and board clock change events.
    * Added ingestion of new ION ion_buffer_create/destroy events.
    * Added ingestion of TrustZone (scm start/end) events.
    * Added SurfaceFlinger derived events (tracking of missed frames).
    * Changed parsing of scheduler task state on 4.14 kernels.
    * Changed importing of Java heap graphs: allow partial dumps.
    * Improved performance of the SQL query engine.

  UI:
    * Added dedicated query page for custom SQL queries.
    * Added navigation links for Binder slices.
    * Removed overview summary mode when zoomed out.
    * Fixed recording page when targeting Android P.
    * Improved slice pan/zoom performance by quantizing.
