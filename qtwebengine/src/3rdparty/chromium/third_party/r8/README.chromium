Update Instructions:
# Download R8:
git clone https://r8.googlesource.com/r8
cd r8
# Find latest tag:
git fetch origin --tags
git tag -l  # Often unnecessary as output from the fetch includes recent tags.
git checkout $TAG  # e.g. 2.2.9-dev

# Apply patches:
git checkout -b my_branch
git am $CHROMIUM_SRC/third_party/r8/patches/*.patch
# Build:
tools/gradle.py r8
# Shrink (improves r8/d8 launch time):
java -jar build/libs/r8.jar --debug --classfile --output r8.jar \
    --lib $CHROMIUM_SRC/third_party/jdk/current --pg-conf src/main/keep.txt \
    --no-minification --no-desugaring build/libs/r8.jar
rm $CHROMIUM_SRC/third_party/r8/lib/r8.jar
cp r8.jar $CHROMIUM_SRC/third_party/r8/lib/r8.jar

# Create patches if conflicts / new patches. Change number if expecting
# different amount of patches:
git format-patch -3 -o $CHROMIUM_SRC/third_party/r8/patches

# Upload to CIPD:
cd $CHROMIUM_SRC/third_party/r8
cipd create --pkg-def cipd.yaml # Make note of the instance ID

# Manually update:
* README.chromium (version number via "java -cp lib/r8.jar com.android.tools.r8.R8 --version")
* //DEPS (instance ID output by cipd create)
