Description:
This package specifies a means for obtaining objects in such a way as to
maximize reusability, testability and maintainability compared to traditional
approaches such as constructors, factories, and service locators (e.g., JNDI).
This process, known as dependency injection, is beneficial to most nontrivial
applications.
IMPORTANT: There should only be one version of espresso library
