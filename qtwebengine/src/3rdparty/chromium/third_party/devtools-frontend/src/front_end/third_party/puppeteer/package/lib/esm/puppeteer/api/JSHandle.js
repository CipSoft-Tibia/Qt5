/**
 * Represents a reference to a JavaScript object. Instances can be created using

 *
 * Handles prevent the referenced JavaScript object from being garbage-collected
 * unless the handle is purposely {@link JSHandle.dispose | disposed}. JSHandles
 * are auto-disposed when their associated frame is navigated away or the parent
 * context gets destroyed.
 *
 * Handles can be used as arguments for any evaluation function such as
 * {@link Page.$eval}, {@link Page.evaluate}, and {@link Page.evaluateHandle}.
 * They are resolved to their referenced object.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```ts
 * const windowHandle = await page.evaluateHandle(() => window);
