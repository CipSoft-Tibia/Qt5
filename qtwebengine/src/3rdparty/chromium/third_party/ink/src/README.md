# Ink

The Ink library is a freehand stroke generation library. It produces smoothed,
modeled stroke shapes with brush effect shaders as mesh-based vector graphics.

## How to Build and Test

### Bazel

#### Prerequisites:

*   Bazel 7: https://bazel.build/install
*   Android NDK: https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads
    *   Download and set `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` to point to it.
    *   Alternately use `sdkmanager` or Android Studio:
        https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk
*   You may need to install libtinfo for clang
    *   `sudo apt-get install libtinfo5`

Ink can be built and tested from the repo root:

```shell
bazel test --config=linux ink/...
```

## Library Structure

Ink consists of a set of modules that can be used separately. You should only
need to include the parts of the library that you need.

```

*   `color`: color spaces, encoding, and format conversion.
*   `types`: utility types; time, units, constants, small arrays, URIs.
*   `geometry`: geometric types (point, segment, triangle, rect, quad), meshes,
    transforms, utility functons, and algorithms (intersection, envelope).
*   `strokes`: the primary `Stroke` data type and `InProgressStroke` builder.
*   `rendering`: rendering utilities for strokes. Currently only has support for
    android.graphics.Mesh based rendering.
*   `storage`: Protobuf serialization utilities for `Stroke` and related types.
