// For a given polyline this algorithm aims to (1) identify and create any
// connections that the user may have intended to make but did not fully connect
// and (2) trim any extra end points that the user did not intend to be part of
// the selected area. To do this, the algorithm completes 3 main tasks:
//
// 1.  Find the first and last intersections in the polyline.
// 2.  Find the best connections for the first and last points of the polyline.
// 3.  Construct a new polyline based on the intersections and connections
//     found in step 1 and 2.
//     3.1. If there are no intersections found or connections to be made, then
//     the new polyline will be the same as the input polyline.
//     3.2. For any endpoint that is not connectable, any points past the
//     nearest intersection point will be trimmed off that end of the polyline.
//     3.3. For any endpoint that is connectable, it will not be trimmed and an
//     additional point will be added for the new connection.
//
// A key component to the algorithm is how it determines whether an endpoint is
// connectable to another point along the polyline.
// This determination is configurable with the following parameters:
//
// min_walk_distance: The minimum walking distance that a point must be from the
//                    endpoint to be considered valid for connection.
// max_connection_distance: The maximum straight line distance that can be
//                          between the endpoint and any valid connection point.
// min_connection_ratio: The “walking distance from endpoint to point” / “the
//                       straight-line distance from endpoint to point” must be
//                       greater than this value for any valid connection point.
//                       This value must be >1 to have any effect.
// min_trimming_ratio: The “walking distance from endpoint to the nearest
//                     intersection point” / “the straight-line distance from
//                     endpoint to point” must be greater than this value for
//                     any valid connection point.
