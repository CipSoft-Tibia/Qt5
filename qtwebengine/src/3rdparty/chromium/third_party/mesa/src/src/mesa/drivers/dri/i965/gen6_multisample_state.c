       * Rationale: in a solution to the 8 queens puzzle, no two queens share
       * a row, column, or diagonal.  This is a desirable property for samples
       * in a multisampling pattern, because it ensures that the samples are
       * relatively uniformly distributed through the pixel.
       *
       * There are several solutions to the 8 queens puzzle (see
       * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle).  This solution was
       * chosen because it has a queen close to the center; this should
       * improve the accuracy of centroid interpolation, since the hardware
       * implements centroid interpolation by choosing the centermost sample
       * that overlaps with the primitive being drawn.
       *
       * Note: from the Ivy Bridge PRM, Vol2 Part1 p304 (3DSTATE_MULTISAMPLE:
       * Programming Notes):
       *
       *     "When programming the sample offsets (for NUMSAMPLES_4 or _8 and
       *     MSRASTMODE_xxx_PATTERN), the order of the samples 0 to 3 (or 7
       *     for 8X) must have monotonically increasing distance from the
       *     pixel center. This is required to get the correct centroid
       *     computation in the device."
