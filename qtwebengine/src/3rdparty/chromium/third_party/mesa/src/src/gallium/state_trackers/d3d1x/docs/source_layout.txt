Source layout and architecture of the Gallium D3D state tracker

w32api is a link to Wine's include files for the Windows API 
d3dapi contains the headers for Direct3D 10.0, 10.1 and 11.0 (independently created, except d3d10 which is based on Wine)
gd3dapi contains the Gallium COM state tracker API and extensions to the DXGI and Direct3D APIs, both for internal and external usage
d3d1xshader is a standalone module with a parser, disassembler and utility routines for Direct3D 10/11 shaders using Shader Model 4/5 instructions encoded using Tokenized Program Format embedded in a DXBC chunked container (the data format produced by the HLSL compiler).
mstools contains a downloader for the Microsoft HLSL compiler
tools contains the shader compiler, currently wrapping the Microsoft HLSL compiler
gd3d10 contains the implementation of Direct3D 10 and 10.1 with Gallium-specific entry points
gd3d11 contains the implementation of Direct3D 11 with Gallium-specific entry points
gd3d1x contains the shader translator and code not directly implementing Direct3D interfaces, but needed by those implementations
dxgid3d10 contains the DXGI-based "official" entry points to Direct3D 10.0 and 10.1
dxgid3d11 contains the DXGI-based "official" entry points to Direct3D 11
dxgi contains the implementation of DXGI (currently over the EGL native interface)
d3d1xstutil contains helper code shared among all the modules in the state tracker 
programs contains the Gallium Direct3D 11 demos, runnable either on the Microsoft or Gallium implementations
docs contains documentation
