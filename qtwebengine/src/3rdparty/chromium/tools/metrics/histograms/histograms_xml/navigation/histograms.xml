    This metric logs true if all the previous entries are marked to be skipped
    on back/forward button via the history manipulation intervention. This is
    logged when back button is pressed (see crbug.com/907167). The goal of the

    such that the user is not able to use the back button to go to the previous
    site they interacted with.
