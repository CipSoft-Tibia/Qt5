## WebEngine Markdown Editor Example

This example uses [QWebEngineView](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwebengineview.html)
to preview text written using the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
syntax.

### Acknowledgments

The conversion from Markdown to HTML is done with the help of the
[marked JavaScript library](https://github.com/chjj/marked) by _Christopher Jeffrey_.
The [style sheet](https://kevinburke.bitbucket.io/markdowncss/)
was created by _Kevin Burke_.
