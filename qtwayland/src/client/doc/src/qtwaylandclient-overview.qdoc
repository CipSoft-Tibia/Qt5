  \title Qt Wayland Client
  \brief Library to enable connecting to a Wayland compositor as a client

  The Qt Wayland Client library provides the necessary functions for an application to act
  as a \l {https://wayland.freedesktop.org/}{Wayland} client and connect to a Wayland compositor.
  For most use cases, the library is used automatically through the Wayland QPA plugin, and there is
  no need for the application itself to use any functions from the library.

  However, when paired with \l{Qt Wayland Compositor}, the cmake function
  \l{qt_generate_wayland_protocol_client_sources}{qt_generate_wayland_protocol_client_sources()}
  can be used to create custom protocol extensions.
