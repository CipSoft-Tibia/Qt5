The WaylandGlobalPrivate module is a module that contains configure
features, shared by the modules of the qtwayland repository.

The actual definition of this module is in src/CMakeLists.txt,
because we need to have the qt_find_package calls in a directory scope
above src/client and src/compositor.

This file here mostly exists to make the otherwise empty src/global
directory known to git.
