    <description summary="internal protocol for buffer sharing">
      This protocol is used internally by Qt for implementing the
      qt_server_buffer extension on hardware that supports Linux dma-buf.

      This protocol is not part of the Qt API.  It exists purely as an
      implementation detail and may change from version to
      version without notice, or even be removed.
