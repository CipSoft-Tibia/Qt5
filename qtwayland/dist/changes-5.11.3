 - [QTBUG-70163] Fixed a bug where destroying a WaylandQuickItem would
   delete the OpenGL texture for all other WaylandQuickItems using that
   surface.
 - Fixed a bug that caused some clients to abort in libwayland when a
   surface left an output.
 - [QTBUG-69384] QWaylandView::surfaceDestroyed is now emitted before the
   surface is destroyed, fixing close animations.
