 - [QTBUG-71697] Added a new hardware-integration supporting eglstreams on
   NVIDIA platforms. It can be enabled by setting
   QT_WAYLAND_CLIENT_BUFFER_INTEGRATION=wayland-eglstream-controller in the
   environment. This fixes showing a black frame when resizing client windows.
   In addition some flickering problems got fixed, which happened when
   the client repainted very often or running without window decorations.
