Qt 5.12.6 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 5.12.0 through 5.12.5.

For more details, refer to the online documentation included in this
distribution. The documentation is also available online:

https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/index.html

The Qt version 5.12 series is binary compatible with the 5.11.x series.
Applications compiled for 5.11 will continue to run with 5.12.

 - Fixed various rounding errors related to touch and mouse input.
 - Fixed a crash when trying to maximize an XdgTopLevel with no output.

 - Important Behavior Changes:
   * Fixed potential memory access violation.
     Between version 5.11 and 5.12 binary compatibility for the
     wayland compositor module was broken by increasing the size of
     various classes. This was unfortunately not visible in public
     headers. As a consequence, application C++ code allocating or
     subclassing any of the following classes would have potential
     memory access violations: QWaylandKeymap, QWaylandQuickOutput,
     QWaylandQuickSurface, QWaylandIviSurface, QWaylandWlShellSurface,
     QWaylandXdgSurface, QWaylandXdgSurfaceV5, QWaylandXdgPopupV5,
     QWaylandXdgSurfaceV6. To mitigate this issue, upgrade Qt to
     5.12.6 and recompile all compositor code. Do not run a compositor
     built with 5.11 or earlier against Qt versions 5.12 or later.

 - Fixed a freeze that happened when starting a drag-and-drop operation
   without a valid source surface.
 - Fixed a 100 ms freeze that would occur if applications did not draw
   after receiving a deliverUpdateRequest().
 - Fixed touch point position rounding errors.
 - Fixed a freeze that could happen when showing a window.
 - Fixed an issue where touch focus would be set to false before all touch
   points where released.
 - Fixed touch event touch points sometimes being reordered, which caused
   issues with QtQuick's MultiPointTouchArea.
 - Fixed a crash that happened with very long window titles using UTF-16
   characters.
