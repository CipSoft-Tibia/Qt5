Client
------

 - [QTBUG-84226] Added support for environment variable
   QT_WAYLAND_FORCE_NONBLOCKING_SWAP_SUPPORT, which can be used to force the
   resolution of detecting if EGL driver supports non-blocking eglSwapBuffers
   call. If you encounter application freezing while waiting indefinitely for a
   buffer swap, then try setting variable to 0.
