    \class QLinuxFbFunctions
    \inmodule QtPlatformHeaders

    \brief The QLinuxFbFunctions class is an inline class containing
    platform-specific functionality for the linuxfb platform plugin that is
    typically used on systems running Embedded Linux or Android.

    \note There is no binary compatibility guarantee for this class,
    meaning that an application using it is only guaranteed to work with the Qt
    version it was developed against.
*/

/*!
    \typedef QLinuxFbFunctions::LoadKeymapType

    Function type for loadKeymap.
*/

/*!
    \fn QByteArray QLinuxFbFunctions::loadKeymapTypeIdentifier()

    \return the identifier that can be passed to
    QGuiApplication::platformFunction() to query the entry point for the
    loadKeymap function implementation.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QLinuxFbFunctions::loadKeymap(const QString &filename)

    Loads and switches to the keymap from \a filename. When \a filename is
    empty, the default keymap, which is either the built-on one or the keymap
    given in the plugin specification, is restored.

    \note This is functional only when the evdev keyboard support code is
    compiled in to the platform plugin. When using external generic plugins via
    the \c{-plugin} argument, or when the environment variable
    \c{QT_QPA_FB_DISABLE_INPUT} is set or when building Qt without evdev
    support, this function will have no effect.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QLinuxFbFunctions::switchLang()

    Switches between English and other language when the keymap is loaded.
    Usually the keymap contains two languages: English and national. When
    you load the keymap, English is selected by default. This function allows
    to switch between these languages.

    \note This is functional only when the evdev keyboard support code is
    compiled in to the platform plugin. When using external generic plugins via
    the \c{-plugin} argument, or when the environment variable
    \c{QT_QPA_FB_DISABLE_INPUT} is set or when building Qt without evdev
    support, this function will have no effect.
