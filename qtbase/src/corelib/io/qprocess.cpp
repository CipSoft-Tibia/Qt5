    \brief The QProcessEnvironment class holds the environment variables that
    can be passed to a program.

    \ingroup io
    \ingroup misc
    \ingroup shared
    \reentrant
    \since 4.6

    A process's environment is composed of a set of key=value pairs known as
    environment variables. The QProcessEnvironment class wraps that concept
    and allows easy manipulation of those variables. It's meant to be used
    along with QProcess, to set the environment for child processes. It
    cannot be used to change the current process's environment.

    The environment of the calling process can be obtained using
    QProcessEnvironment::systemEnvironment().

    On Unix systems, the variable names are case-sensitive. Note that the
    Unix environment allows both variable names and contents to contain arbitrary
    binary data (except for the NUL character). QProcessEnvironment will preserve
    such variables, but does not support manipulating variables whose names or
    values cannot be encoded by the current locale settings (see
    QString::toLocal8Bit).

    On Windows, the variable names are case-insensitive, but case-preserving.
    QProcessEnvironment behaves accordingly.

    \brief The QProcess class is used to start external programs and
    to communicate with them.

    \ingroup io

    \reentrant

    \section1 Running a Process

    To start a process, pass the name and command line arguments of
    the program you want to run as arguments to start(). Arguments
    are supplied as individual strings in a QStringList.

    Alternatively, you can set the program to run with setProgram()
    and setArguments(), and then call start() or open().

    For example, the following code snippet runs the analog clock
    example in the Fusion style on X11 platforms by passing strings
    containing "-style" and "fusion" as two items in the list of
    arguments:

    \snippet qprocess/qprocess-simpleexecution.cpp 0
    \dots
    \snippet qprocess/qprocess-simpleexecution.cpp 1
    \snippet qprocess/qprocess-simpleexecution.cpp 2

    QProcess then enters the \l Starting state, and when the program
    has started, QProcess enters the \l Running state and emits
    started().

    QProcess allows you to treat a process as a sequential I/O
    device. You can write to and read from the process just as you
    would access a network connection using QTcpSocket. You can then
    write to the process's standard input by calling write(), and
    read the standard output by calling read(), readLine(), and
    getChar(). Because it inherits QIODevice, QProcess can also be
    used as an input source for QXmlReader, or for generating data to
    be uploaded using QNetworkAccessManager.

    When the process exits, QProcess reenters the \l NotRunning state
    (the initial state), and emits finished().

    The finished() signal provides the exit code and exit status of
    the process as arguments, and you can also call exitCode() to
    obtain the exit code of the last process that finished, and
    exitStatus() to obtain its exit status. If an error occurs at
    any point in time, QProcess will emit the errorOccurred() signal.
    You can also call error() to find the type of error that occurred
    last, and state() to find the current process state.

    \note QProcess is not supported on VxWorks, iOS, tvOS, or watchOS.

    \section1 Finding the Executable

    The program to be run can be set either by calling setProgram() or directly
    in the start() call. The effect of calling start() with the program name
    and arguments is equivalent to calling setProgram() and setArguments()
    before that function and then calling the overload without those
    parameters.

    QProcess interprets the program name in one of three different ways,
    similar to how Unix shells and the Windows command interpreter operate in
    their own command-lines:

    \list
      \li If the program name is an absolute path, then that is the exact
      executable that will be launched and QProcess performs no searching.

      \li If the program name is a relative path with more than one path
      component (that is, it contains at least one slash), the starting
      directory where that relative path is searched is OS-dependent: on
      Windows, it's the parent process' current working dir, while on Unix it's
      the one set with setWorkingDirectory().

      \li If the program name is a plain file name with no slashes, the
      behavior is operating-system dependent. On Unix systems, QProcess will
      search the \c PATH environment variable; on Windows, the search is
      performed by the OS and will first the parent process' current directory
      before the \c PATH environment variable (see the documentation for
      \l{CreateProcess} for the full list).
    \endlist

    To avoid platform-dependent behavior or any issues with how the current
    application was launched, it is advisable to always pass an absolute path
    to the executable to be launched. For auxiliary binaries shipped with the
    application, one can construct such a path starting with
    QCoreApplication::applicationDirPath(). Similarly, to explicitly run an
    executable that is to be found relative to the directory set with
    setWorkingDirectory(), use a program path starting with "./" or "../" as
    the case may be.

    On Windows, the ".exe" suffix is not required for most uses, except those
    outlined in the \l{CreateProcess} documentation. Additionally, QProcess
    will convert the Unix-style forward slashes to Windows path backslashes for
    the program name. This allows code using QProcess to be written in a
    cross-platform manner, as shown in the examples above.

    QProcess does not support directly executing Unix shell or Windows command
    interpreter built-in functions, such as \c{cmd.exe}'s \c dir command or the
    Bourne shell's \c export. On Unix, even though many shell built-ins are
    also provided as separate executables, their behavior may differ from those
    implemented as built-ins. To run those commands, one should explicitly
    execute the interpreter with suitable options. For Unix systems, launch
    "/bin/sh" with two arguments: "-c" and a string with the command-line to be
    run. For Windows, due to the non-standard way \c{cmd.exe} parses its
    command-line, use setNativeArguments() (for example, "/c dir d:").

    \section1 Environment variables

    The QProcess API offers methods to manipulate the environment variables
    that the child process will see. By default, the child process will have a
    copy of the current process environment variables that exist at the time
    the start() function is called. This means that any modifications performed
    using qputenv() prior to that call will be reflected in the child process'
    environment. Note that QProcess makes no attempt to prevent race conditions
    with qputenv() happening in other threads, so it is recommended to avoid
    qputenv() after the application's initial start up.

    The environment for a specific child can be modified using the
    processEnvironment() and setProcessEnvironment() functions, which use the
    \l QProcessEnvironment class. By default, processEnvironment() will return
    an object for which QProcessEnvironment::inheritsFromParent() is true.
    Setting an environment that does not inherit from the parent will cause
    QProcess to use exactly that environment for the child when it is started.

    The normal scenario starts from the current environment by calling
    QProcessEnvironment::systemEnvironment() and then proceeds to adding,
    changing, or removing specific variables. The resulting variable roster can
    then be applied to a QProcess with setProcessEnvironment().

    It is possible to remove all variables from the environment or to start
    from an empty environment, using the QProcessEnvironment() default
    constructor. This is not advisable outside of controlled and
    system-specific conditions, as there may be system variables that are set
    in the current process environment and are required for proper execution
    of the child process.

    On Windows, QProcess will copy the current process' \c "PATH" and \c
    "SystemRoot" environment variables if they were unset. It is not possible
    to unset them completely, but it is possible to set them to empty values.
    Setting \c "PATH" to empty on Windows will likely cause the child process
    to fail to start.

    \section1 Communicating via Channels

    Processes have two predefined output channels: The standard
    output channel (\c stdout) supplies regular console output, and
    the standard error channel (\c stderr) usually supplies the
    errors that are printed by the process. These channels represent
    two separate streams of data. You can toggle between them by
    calling setReadChannel(). QProcess emits readyRead() when data is
    available on the current read channel. It also emits
    readyReadStandardOutput() when new standard output data is
    available, and when new standard error data is available,
    readyReadStandardError() is emitted. Instead of calling read(),
    readLine(), or getChar(), you can explicitly read all data from
    either of the two channels by calling readAllStandardOutput() or
    readAllStandardError().

    The terminology for the channels can be misleading. Be aware that
    the process's output channels correspond to QProcess's
    \e read channels, whereas the process's input channels correspond
    to QProcess's \e write channels. This is because what we read
    using QProcess is the process's output, and what we write becomes
    the process's input.

    QProcess can merge the two output channels, so that standard
    output and standard error data from the running process both use
    the standard output channel. Call setProcessChannelMode() with
    MergedChannels before starting the process to activate
    this feature. You also have the option of forwarding the output of
    the running process to the calling, main process, by passing
    ForwardedChannels as the argument. It is also possible to forward
    only one of the output channels - typically one would use
    ForwardedErrorChannel, but ForwardedOutputChannel also exists.
    Note that using channel forwarding is typically a bad idea in GUI
    applications - you should present errors graphically instead.

    Certain processes need special environment settings in order to
    operate. You can set environment variables for your process by
    calling setProcessEnvironment(). To set a working directory, call
    setWorkingDirectory(). By default, processes are run in the
    current working directory of the calling process.

    The positioning and the screen Z-order of windows belonging to
    GUI applications started with QProcess are controlled by
    the underlying windowing system. For Qt 5 applications, the
    positioning can be specified using the \c{-qwindowgeometry}
    command line option; X11 applications generally accept a
    \c{-geometry} command line option.

    \section1 Synchronous Process API

    QProcess provides a set of functions which allow it to be used
    without an event loop, by suspending the calling thread until
    certain signals are emitted:

    \list
    \li waitForStarted() blocks until the process has started.

    \li waitForReadyRead() blocks until new data is
    available for reading on the current read channel.

    \li waitForBytesWritten() blocks until one payload of
    data has been written to the process.

    \li waitForFinished() blocks until the process has finished.
    \endlist

    Calling these functions from the main thread (the thread that
    calls QApplication::exec()) may cause your user interface to
    freeze.

    The following example runs \c gzip to compress the string "Qt
    rocks!", without an event loop:

    \snippet process/process.cpp 0

    \value MergedChannels QProcess merges the output of the running

    running process is forwarded onto the main process.

    \value ForwardedChannels QProcess forwards the output of the
    running process onto the main process. Anything the child process
    writes to its standard output and standard error will be written
    to the standard output and standard error of the main process.

    \value ForwardedErrorChannel QProcess manages the standard output
    of the running process, but forwards its standard error onto the
    main process. This reflects the typical use of command line tools
    as filters, where the standard output is redirected to another
    process or a file, while standard error is printed to the console
    for diagnostic purposes.
    (This value was introduced in Qt 5.2.)

    \value ForwardedOutputChannel Complementary to ForwardedErrorChannel.

    \note Windows intentionally suppresses output from GUI-only
    applications to inherited consoles.
    This does \e not apply to output redirected to files or pipes.
    To forward the output of GUI-only applications on the console

/*!
    \typedef QProcess::CreateProcessArgumentModifier
    \note This typedef is only available on desktop Windows.

    On Windows, QProcess uses the Win32 API function \c CreateProcess to
    start child processes. While QProcess provides a comfortable way to start
    processes without worrying about platform
    details, it is in some cases desirable to fine-tune the parameters that are
    passed to \c CreateProcess. This is done by defining a
    \c CreateProcessArgumentModifier function and passing it to
    \c setCreateProcessArgumentsModifier.

    A \c CreateProcessArgumentModifier function takes one parameter: a pointer
    to a \c CreateProcessArguments struct. The members of this struct will be
    passed to \c CreateProcess after the \c CreateProcessArgumentModifier
    function is called.

    The following example demonstrates how to pass custom flags to
    \c CreateProcess.
    When starting a console process B from a console process A, QProcess will
    reuse the console window of process A for process B by default. In this
    example, a new console window with a custom color scheme is created for the
    child process B instead.

    function \c CreateProcess. It is used as parameter for

*/

/*!
    \class QProcess::UnixProcessParameters
    \inmodule QtCore
    \note This struct is only available on Unix platforms
    \since 6.6

    This struct can be used to pass extra, Unix-specific configuration for the
    child process using QProcess::setUnixProcessParameters().

    Its members are:
    \list
    \li UnixProcessParameters::flags    Flags, see QProcess::UnixProcessFlags
    \li UnixProcessParameters::lowestFileDescriptorToClose  The lowest file
            descriptor to close.
    \endlist

    When the QProcess::UnixProcessFlags::CloseFileDescriptors flag is set in
    the \c flags field, QProcess closes the application's open file descriptors
    before executing the child process. The descriptors 0, 1, and 2 (that is,
    \c stdin, \c stdout, and \c stderr) are left alone, along with the ones
    numbered lower than the value of the \c lowestFileDescriptorToClose field.

    All of the settings above can also be manually achieved by calling the
    respective POSIX function from a handler set with
    QProcess::setChildProcessModifier(). This structure allows QProcess to deal
    with any platform-specific differences, benefit from certain optimizations,
    and reduces code duplication. Moreover, if any of those functions fail,
    QProcess will enter QProcess::FailedToStart state, while the child process
    modifier callback is not allowed to fail.

    \sa QProcess::setUnixProcessParameters(), QProcess::setChildProcessModifier()
*/

/*!
    \enum QProcess::UnixProcessFlag
    \since 6.6

    These flags can be used in the \c flags field of \l UnixProcessParameters.

    \value CloseFileDescriptors  Close all file descriptors above the threshold
           defined by \c lowestFileDescriptorToClose, preventing any currently
           open descriptor in the parent process from accidentally leaking to the
           child. The \c stdin, \c stdout, and \c stderr file descriptors are
           never closed.

    \value [since 6.7] CreateNewSession  Starts a new process session, by calling
           \c{setsid(2)}. This allows the child process to outlive the session
           the current process is in. This is one of the steps that
           startDetached() takes to allow the process to detach, and is also one
           of the steps to daemonize a process.

    \value [since 6.7] DisconnectControllingTerminal   Requests that the process
           disconnect from its controlling terminal, if it has one. If it has
           none, nothing happens. Processes still connected to a controlling
           terminal may get a Hang Up (\c SIGHUP) signal if the terminal
           closes, or one of the other terminal-control signals (\c SIGTSTP, \c
           SIGTTIN, \c SIGTTOU). Note that on some operating systems, a process
           may only disconnect from the controlling terminal if it is the
           session leader, meaning the \c CreateNewSession flag may be
           required. Like it, this is one of the steps to daemonize a process.

    \value IgnoreSigPipe    Always sets the \c SIGPIPE signal to ignored
           (\c SIG_IGN), even if the \c ResetSignalHandlers flag was set. By
           default, if the child attempts to write to its standard output or
           standard error after the respective channel was closed with
           QProcess::closeReadChannel(), it would get the \c SIGPIPE signal and
           terminate immediately; with this flag, the write operation fails
           without a signal and the child may continue executing.

    \value [since 6.7] ResetIds     Drops any retained, effective user or group
           ID the current process may still have (see \c{setuid(2)} and
           \c{setgid(2)}, plus QCoreApplication::setSetuidAllowed()). This is
           useful if the current process was setuid or setgid and does not wish
           the child process to retain the elevated privileges.

    \value ResetSignalHandlers  Resets all Unix signal handlers back to their
           default state (that is, pass \c SIG_DFL to \c{signal(2)}). This flag
           is useful to ensure any ignored (\c SIG_IGN) signal does not affect
           the child's behavior.

    \value UseVFork  Requests that QProcess use \c{vfork(2)} to start the child
           process. Use this flag to indicate that the callback function set
           with setChildProcessModifier() is safe to execute in the child side of
           a \c{vfork(2)}; that is, the callback does not modify any non-local
           variables (directly or through any function it calls), nor attempts
           to communicate with the parent process. It is implementation-defined
           if QProcess will actually use \c{vfork(2)} and if \c{vfork(2)} is
           different from standard \c{fork(2)}.

/*!
    \since 6.0

    Sets the \a modifier function for the child process, for Unix systems
    (including \macos; for Windows, see setCreateProcessArgumentsModifier()).
    The function contained by the \a modifier argument will be invoked in the
    child process after \c{fork()} or \c{vfork()} is completed and QProcess has
    set up the standard file descriptors for the child process, but before
    \c{execve()}, inside start().

    The following shows an example of setting up a child process to run without
    privileges:

    \snippet code/src_corelib_io_qprocess.cpp 4

    If the modifier function experiences a failure condition, it can use
    failChildProcessModifier() to report the situation to the QProcess caller.
    Alternatively, it may use other methods of stopping the process, like
    \c{_exit()}, or \c{abort()}.

    Certain properties of the child process, such as closing all extraneous
    file descriptors or disconnecting from the controlling TTY, can be more
    readily achieved by using setUnixProcessParameters(), which can detect
    failure and report a \l{QProcess::}{FailedToStart} condition. The modifier
    is useful to change certain uncommon properties of the child process, such
    as setting up additional file descriptors. If both a child process modifier
    and Unix process parameters are set, the modifier is run before these
    parameters are applied.

    \note In multithreaded applications, this function must be careful not to
    call any functions that may lock mutexes that may have been in use in
    other threads (in general, using only functions defined by POSIX as
    "async-signal-safe" is advised). Most of the Qt API is unsafe inside this
    callback, including qDebug(), and may lead to deadlocks.

    \note If the UnixProcessParameters::UseVFork flag is set via
    setUnixProcessParameters(), QProcess may use \c{vfork()} semantics to
    start the child process, so this function must obey even stricter
    constraints. First, because it is still sharing memory with the parent
    process, it must not write to any non-local variable and must obey proper
    ordering semantics when reading from them, to avoid data races. Second,
    even more library functions may misbehave; therefore, this function should
    only make use of low-level system calls, such as \c{read()},
    \c{write()}, \c{setsid()}, \c{nice()}, and similar.

    \sa childProcessModifier(), failChildProcessModifier(), setUnixProcessParameters()

    \fn void QProcess::failChildProcessModifier(const char *description, int error) noexcept
    \since 6.7

    This functions can be used inside the modifier set with
    setChildProcessModifier() to indicate an error condition was encountered.
    When the modifier calls these functions, QProcess will emit errorOccurred()
    with code QProcess::FailedToStart in the parent process. The \a description
    can be used to include some information in errorString() to help diagnose
    the problem, usually the name of the call that failed, similar to the C
    Library function \c{perror()}. Additionally, the \a error parameter can be
    an \c{<errno.h>} error code whose text form will also be included.

    For example, a child modifier could prepare an extra file descriptor for
    the child process this way:

    \code
        process.setChildProcessModifier([fd, &process]() {
            if (dup2(fd, TargetFileDescriptor) < 0)
                process.failChildProcessModifier(errno, "aux comm channel");
        });
        process.start();
    \endcode

    Where \c{fd} is a file descriptor currently open in the parent process. If
    the \c{dup2()} system call resulted in an \c EBADF condition, the process
    errorString() could be "Child process modifier reported error: aux comm
    channel: Bad file descriptor".

    This function does not return to the caller. Using it anywhere except in
    the child modifier and with the correct QProcess object is undefined
    behavior.

    \note The implementation imposes a length limit to the \a description
    parameter to about 500 characters. This does not include the text from the

    On operating systems where the system API for passing command line
    arguments to a subprocess natively uses a single string (Windows), one can
    conceive command lines which cannot be passed via QProcess's portable
    list-based API. In these rare cases you need to use setProgram() and
    setNativeArguments() instead of this function.

    \since 5.10

    Starts the program set by setProgram() with arguments set by setArguments()
    in a new process, and detaches from it. Returns \c true on success;
    otherwise returns \c false. If the calling process exits, the
    detached process will continue to run unaffected.

    \b{Unix:} The started process will run in its own session and act
    like a daemon.

    The process will be started in the directory set by setWorkingDirectory().
    If workingDirectory() is empty, the working directory is inherited
    from the calling process.

    If the function is successful then *\a pid is set to the process identifier
    of the started process; otherwise, it's set to -1. Note that the child
    process may exit and the PID may become invalid without notice.
    Furthermore, after the child process exits, the same PID may be recycled
    and used by a completely different process. User code should be careful
    when using this variable, especially if one intends to forcibly terminate
    the process by operating system means.

    Only the following property setters are supported by startDetached():
    \list
    \li setArguments()
    \li setCreateProcessArgumentsModifier()
    \li setNativeArguments()
    \li setProcessEnvironment()
