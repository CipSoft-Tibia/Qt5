  \class QSystemSemaphore
  \inmodule QtCore
  \since 4.4

  \brief The QSystemSemaphore class provides a general counting system semaphore.

  A system semaphore is a generalization of \l QSemaphore. Typically, a
  semaphore is used to protect a certain number of identical resources.

  Like its lighter counterpart, a QSystemSemaphore can be
  accessed from multiple \l {QThread} {threads}. Unlike QSemaphore, a
  QSystemSemaphore can also be accessed from multiple \l {QProcess}
  {processes}. This means QSystemSemaphore is a much heavier class, so
  if your application doesn't need to access your semaphores across
  multiple processes, you will probably want to use QSemaphore.

  Semaphores support two fundamental operations, acquire() and release():

  acquire() tries to acquire one resource. If there isn't a resource
  available, the call blocks until a resource becomes available. Then
  the resource is acquired and the call returns.

  release() releases one resource so it can be acquired by another
  process. The function can also be called with a parameter n > 1,
  which releases n resources.

  System semaphores are identified by a key, represented by \l QNativeIpcKey. A
  key can be created in a cross-platform manner by using platformSafeKey(). A
  system semaphore is created by the QSystemSemaphore constructor when passed
  an access mode parameter of AccessMode::Create. Once it is created, other
  processes may attach to the same semaphore using the same key and an access
  mode parameter of AccessMode::Open.

  Example: Create a system semaphore
  \snippet code/src_corelib_kernel_qsystemsemaphore.cpp 0

  For details on the key types, platform-specific limitations, and
  interoperability with older or non-Qt applications, see the \l{Native IPC
  Keys} documentation. That includes important information for sandboxed
  applications on Apple platforms, including all apps obtained via the Apple
  App Store.

/*!
  Requests a system semaphore for the specified \a key. The parameters
  \a initialValue and \a mode are used according to the following
  rules, which are system dependent.

  In Unix, if the \a mode is \l {QSystemSemaphore::} {Open} and the
  system already has a semaphore identified by \a key, that semaphore
  is used, and the semaphore's resource count is not changed, i.e., \a
  initialValue is ignored. But if the system does not already have a
  semaphore identified by \a key, it creates a new semaphore for that
  key and sets its resource count to \a initialValue.

  In Unix, if the \a mode is \l {QSystemSemaphore::} {Create} and the
  system already has a semaphore identified by \a key, that semaphore
  is used, and its resource count is set to \a initialValue. If the
  system does not already have a semaphore identified by \a key, it
  creates a new semaphore for that key and sets its resource count to
  \a initialValue.

  In Windows, \a mode is ignored, and the system always tries to
  create a semaphore for the specified \a key. If the system does not
  already have a semaphore identified as \a key, it creates the
  semaphore and sets its resource count to \a initialValue. But if the
  system already has a semaphore identified as \a key it uses that
  semaphore and ignores \a initialValue.

  The \l {QSystemSemaphore::AccessMode} {mode} parameter is only used
  in Unix systems to handle the case where a semaphore survives a
  process crash. In that case, the next process to allocate a
  semaphore with the same \a key will get the semaphore that survived
  the crash, and unless \a mode is \l {QSystemSemaphore::} {Create},
  the resource count will not be reset to \a initialValue but will
  retain the initial value it had been given by the crashed process.

/*!
  The destructor destroys the QSystemSemaphore object, but the
  underlying system semaphore is not removed from the system unless
  this instance of QSystemSemaphore is the last one existing for that
  system semaphore.

  Two important side effects of the destructor depend on the system.
  In Windows, if acquire() has been called for this semaphore but not
  release(), release() will not be called by the destructor, nor will
  the resource be released when the process exits normally. This would
  be a program bug which could be the cause of a deadlock in another
  process trying to acquire the same resource. In Unix, acquired
  resources that are not released before the destructor is called are
  automatically released when the process exits.

/*!
  \enum QSystemSemaphore::AccessMode

  This enum is used by the constructor and setKey(). Its purpose is to
  enable handling the problem in Unix implementations of semaphores
  that survive a crash. In Unix, when a semaphore survives a crash, we
  need a way to force it to reset its resource count, when the system
  reuses the semaphore. In Windows, where semaphores can't survive a
  crash, this enum has no effect.

  \value Open If the semaphore already exists, its initial resource
  count is not reset. If the semaphore does not already exist, it is
  created and its initial resource count set.

  \value Create QSystemSemaphore takes ownership of the semaphore and
  sets its resource count to the requested value, regardless of
  whether the semaphore already exists by having survived a crash.
  This value should be passed to the constructor, when the first
  semaphore for a particular key is constructed and you know that if
  the semaphore already exists it could only be because of a crash. In
  Windows, where a semaphore can't survive a crash, Create and Open
  have the same behavior.
