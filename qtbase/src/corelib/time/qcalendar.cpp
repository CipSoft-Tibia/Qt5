    \class QCalendarBackend
    \inmodule QtCore
    \internal
    \reentrant
    \brief The QCalendarBackend class provides basic calendaring functions.

    QCalendarBackend provides the base class on which all calendar types are
    implemented. On construction, the backend is registered with its primary
    name.

    A backend, once successfully registered with its primary name, may also be
    registered with aliases, where the calendar is known by several
    names. Registering with the name used by CLDR (the Unicode consortium's
    Common Locale Data Repository) is recommended, particularly when interacting
    with third-party software. Once a backend is registered for a name,
    QCalendar can be constructed using that name to select the backend.

    Each built-in backend has a distinct primary name and all built-in backends
    are instantiated before any custom backend is registered, to prevent custom
    backends with conflicting names from replacing built-in backends.

    Each calendar backend must inherit from QCalendarBackend and implement its
    pure virtual methods. It may also override some other virtual methods, as
    needed.

    Most backends are pure code, with no data elements. Such backends should
    normally be implemented as singletons. For a backend to be added to the
    QCalendar::System \c enum, it must be such a singleton, with a case in
    backendFromEnum()'s switch statement (above) to instantiate it.

    \section1 Instantiating backends

    Backends may be defined by third-party, plugin or user code. When such
    custom backends are instantiated, in their calls to the QCalendarBackend
    base-class constructor, each instance should pass a distinct primary name to
    the base-class constructor and omit the \c system parameter.

    A backend class that has instance variables as well as code may be
    instantiated many times, each with a distinct primary name, to implement
    distinct backends - presumably variants on some parameterized calendar.
    Each instance is then a distinct backend. A pure code backend class shall
    typically only be instantiated once, as it is only capable of representing
    one backend.

    Each backend should be instantiated exactly once, on the heap (using the C++
    \c new operator); this will register it with the QCalendar implementation
    code and ensure it is available, by its primary name, to all code that may
    subsequently need it.  It will be deleted on program termination along with
    the registry in which QCalendar records backends.

    The single exception to this is that each backend's instantiator should
    verify that it was registered successfully with its primary name. It can do
    this by calling registerAlias() with that name; this will return true if it
    is already registered with the name. If it returns false, the instantiation
    has used a name that was already in use so the new backend has not been
    registered and the instantiator retains ownership of the backend instance;
    it will not be accessible to QCalendar. (Since registerAlias() is protected,
    a custom backend's class shall typically need to provide a method to perform
    this check for its instantiator.)

    Built-in backends, identified by QCalendar::System values other than User,
    should only be instantiated by code in the implementation of QCalendar; no
    other code should ever instantiate one. As noted above, such a backend must
    be a singleton. Its constructor passes down the \c enum member that
    identifies it as \c system to the base-class constructor.

    The shareable base-classes for backends, QRomanCalendar and QHijriCalendar,
    are not themselves identified by QCalendar::System and may be used as
    base-classes for custom calendar backends, but cannot be instantiated
    themselves.

    \sa registerAlias(), QDate, QDateTime, QDateEdit, QDateTimeEdit,
        QCalendarWidget

/*!
    Constructs the calendar and registers it under \a name using \a system.

    On successful registration, the calendar backend registry takes over
    ownership of the instance and shall delete it on program exit in the course
    of the registry's own destruction. The instance can determine whether it was
    successfully registered by calling registerAlias() with the same \a name it
    passed to this base-class constructor. If that returns \c false, the
    instance has not been registered, QCalendar cannot use it, it should not
    attempt to register any other aliases and the code that instantiated the
    backend is responsible for deleting it.

    The \a system is optional and should only be passed by built-in
    implementations of the standard calendars documented in \l
    QCalendar::System. Custom backends should not pass \a system.

    Only one backend instance should ever be registered for any given \a system:
    in the event of a backend being created when one with the same \a system
    already exists, the new backend is not registered. The \a name passed with a
    \a system (other than \l{QCalendar::System}{User}) must be the \c{name()} of
    the backend constructed.

    The \a name must be non-empty and unique; after one backend has been
    registered for a name or alias, no other backend can be registered with that
    name. The presence of another backend registered with the same name may mean
    the backend is redundant, as the system already has a backend to handle the
    given calendar type.

    \note \c{QCalendar(name).isValid()} will return true precisely when the
    given \c name is in use already. This can be used as a test before
    instantiating a backend with the given \c name.

    Client code should only call this if instantiation failed to register the

    name it passed to this base-class's constructor. Only a backend that fails
    to register can safely be deleted; and the client code that instantiated it
    is indeed responsible for deleting it.

    Once a backend has been successfully registered, there may be QCalendar
    instances using it; deleting it while they still reference it would lead to
    undefined behavior. Such a backend shall be deleted when the calendar
    backend registry is deleted on program exit; the registry takes over
    ownership of the instance on successful registration.

    Calendars whose dayOfWeek() returns a value outside the range from 1 to 7

    \class QCalendar

    \reentrant
    \brief The QCalendar class describes calendar systems.

    A QCalendar object maps a year, month, and day-number to a specific day
    (ultimately identified by its Julian day number), using the rules of a
    particular system.

    The default QCalendar() is a proleptic Gregorian calendar, which has no year
    zero. Other calendars may be supported by enabling suitable features or
    loading plugins. Calendars supported as features can be constructed by
    passing the QCalendar::System enumeration to the constructor. All supported
    calendars may be constructed by name, once they have been constructed. (Thus
    plugins instantiate their calendar backend to register it.) Built-in
    backends, accessible via QCalendar::System, are also always available by
    name.

    A QCalendar value is immutable.

    \sa QDate, QDateTime
