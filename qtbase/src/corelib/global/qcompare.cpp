    \note Qt's comparison types provide functionality equivalent to their C++20
    standard counterparts. The only reason why they exist is to make the
    functionality available in C++17 builds, too. In a C++20 build, they
    implicitly convert to and from the \c std types, making them fully
    interchangeable. We therefore recommended that you prefer to use the C++
    standard types in your code, if you can use C++20 in your projects already.
    The Qt comparison types will be removed in Qt 7.

    Qt provides several comparison types for a \l
    {https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_comparison#Three-way_comparison}
    {three-way comparison}, which are comparable against a \e {zero literal}.
    To use these comparison types, you need to include the \c <QtCompare>
    header. These comparison types are categorized based on their \e order,
    which is a mathematical concept used to describe the arrangement or ranking
    of elements. The following categories are provided:

    \table 100 %
    \header
        \li C++ type
        \li Qt type
        \li strict
        \li total
        \li Example
    \row
        \li \l {https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/compare/strong_ordering}
        {std::strong_ordering}
        \li Qt::strong_ordering
        \li yes
        \li yes
        \li integral types, case-sensitive strings, QDate, QTime
    \row
        \li \l {https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/compare/weak_ordering}
        {std::weak_ordering}
        \li Qt::weak_ordering
        \li no
        \li yes
        \li case-insensitive strings, unordered associative containers, QDateTime
    \row
        \li \l {https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/compare/partial_ordering}
        {std::partial_ordering}
        \li Qt::partial_ordering
        \li no
        \li no
        \li floating-point types, QOperatingSystemVersion, QVariant
    \endtable

    The strongest comparison type, Qt::strong_ordering, represents a strict total
    order. It requires that any two elements be comparable in a way where
    equality implies substitutability. In other words, equivalent values
    cannot be distinguished from each other. A practical example would be the
    case-sensitive comparison of two strings. For instance, when comparing the
    values \c "Qt" and \c "Qt" the result would be \l Qt::strong_ordering::equal.
    Both values are indistinguishable and all deterministic operations performed
    on these values would yield identical results.

    Qt::weak_ordering represents a total order. While any two values still need to
    be comparable, equivalent values may be distinguishable. The canonical
    example here would be the case-insensitive comparison of two strings. For
    instance, when comparing the values \c "Qt" and \c "qt" both hold the same
    letters but with different representations. This comparison would
    result in \l Qt::weak_ordering::equivalent, but not actually \c Equal.
    Another example would be QDateTime, which can represent a given instant in
    time in terms of local time or any other time-zone, including UTC. The
    different representations are equivalent, even though their \c time() and
    sometimes \c date() may differ.

    Qt::partial_ordering represents, as the name implies, a partial ordering. It
    allows for the possibility that two values may not be comparable, resulting
    in an \l {Qt::partial_ordering::}{unordered} state. Additionally, equivalent
    values may still be distinguishable. A practical example would be the
    comparison of two floating-point values, comparing with NaN (Not-a-Number)
    would yield an unordered result. Another example is the comparison of two
    QOperatingSystemVersion objects. Comparing versions of two different
    operating systems, such as Android and Windows, would produce an unordered
    result.

    Utilizing these comparison types enhances the expressiveness of defining
    relations. Furthermore, they serve as a fundamental component for
    implementing three-way comparison with C++17.

    \brief The <QtCompare> header file defines \c {Qt::*_ordering} types and helper
    macros for defining comparison operators.

    This header introduces the \l Qt::partial_ordering, \l Qt::weak_ordering, and
    \l Qt::strong_ordering types, which are Qt's C++17 backports of
    \c {std::*_ordering} types.

    This header also contains functions for implementing three-way comparison
    in C++17.

    The \c {Qt::compareThreeWay()} function overloads provide three-way
    comparison for built-in C++ types.

    The \l qCompareThreeWay() template serves as a generic three-way comparison
    implementation. It relies on \c {Qt::compareThreeWay()} and free
    \c {compareThreeWay()} functions in its implementation.

    \brief Qt::strong_ordering represents a comparison where equivalent values are
    indistinguishable.
    \sa Qt::weak_ordering, Qt::partial_ordering, {Comparison types overview}
    \since 6.7

    A value of type Qt::strong_ordering is typically returned from a three-way
    comparison function. Such a function compares two objects and establishes
    how they are ordered. It uses this return type to indicate that the ordering
    is strict; that is, the function establishes a well-defined total order.

    Qt::strong_ordering has four values, represented by the following symbolic
    constants:

    \list
    \li \l less represents that the left operand is less than the right;
    \li \l equal represents that the left operand is equivalent to the right;
    \li \l equivalent is an alias for \c equal;
    \li \l greater represents that the left operand is greater than the right.
    \endlist

    Qt::strong_ordering is idiomatically used by comparing an instance against a
    literal zero, for instance like this:

    \code

    // given a, b, c, d as objects of some type that allows for a 3-way compare,
    // and a compare function declared as follows:

    Qt::strong_ordering compare(T lhs, T rhs); // defined out-of-line
    ~~~

    Qt::strong_ordering result = compare(a, b);
    if (result < 0) {
        // a is less than b
    }

    if (compare(c, d) >= 0) {
        // c is greater than or equal to d
    }

    These macros are used to generate \c {operator==()} and \c {operator!=()}.

    In C++17 mode, the mixed-type overloads also generate the reversed
    operators.

    In C++20 mode, only \c {operator==()} is defined. \c {operator!=()},
    as well as the reversed operators for mixed-type comparison, are synthesized
    by the compiler.

    The operators are implemented in terms of a helper function
    \c {comparesEqual()}.
    It's the user's responsibility to declare and define this function.

    Consider the following example of a comparison operators declaration:

    \code
    class MyClass {
        ...
    private:
        friend bool comparesEqual(const MyClass &, const MyClass &) noexcept;
        Q_DECLARE_EQUALITY_COMPARABLE(MyClass)
    };
    \endcode

    When compiled with C++17, the macro will expand into the following code:

    \code
    friend bool operator==(const MyClass &lhs, const MyClass &rhs) noexcept
    {
        // inline implementation which uses comparesEqual()
    }
    friend bool operator!=(const MyClass &lhs, const MyClass &rhs) noexcept
    {
        // inline implementation which uses comparesEqual()
    }
    \endcode

    When compiled with C++20, the macro will expand only into \c {operator==()}:

    \code
    friend bool operator==(const MyClass &lhs, const MyClass &rhs) noexcept
    {
        // inline implementation which uses comparesEqual()
    }
    \endcode

    The \c {*_LITERAL_TYPE} versions of the macros are used to generate
    \c constexpr operators. This means that the helper \c {comparesEqual()}
    function must also be \c constexpr.

    Consider the following example of a mixed-type \c constexpr comparison
    operators declaration:

    \code
    class MyClass {
        ...
    private:
        friend constexpr bool comparesEqual(const MyClass &, int) noexcept;
        Q_DECLARE_EQUALITY_COMPARABLE_LITERAL_TYPE(MyClass, int)

    These macros are used to generate all six relational operators.
    The operators represent
    \l {https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/compare/partial_ordering}
    {partial ordering}.

    These macros use respective overloads of the
    \l {Q_DECLARE_EQUALITY_COMPARABLE} macro to generate \c {operator==()} and
    \c {operator!=()}, and also generate the four relational operators:
    \c {operator<()}, \c {operator>()}, \c {operator<=()}, and \c {operator>()}.

    In C++17 mode, the mixed-type overloads also generate the reversed
    operators.

    In C++20 mode, only \c {operator==()} and \c {operator<=>()} are defined.
    Other operators, as well as the reversed operators for mixed-type
    comparison, are synthesized by the compiler.

    The (in)equality operators are implemented in terms of a helper function
    \c {comparesEqual()}. The other relational operators are implemented in
    terms of a helper function \c {compareThreeWay()}.
    The \c {compareThreeWay()} function \e must return an object of type
    \l Qt::partial_ordering. It's the user's responsibility to declare and define
    both helper functions.

    Consider the following example of a comparison operators declaration:

    \code
    class MyClass {
        ...
    private:
        friend bool comparesEqual(const MyClass &, const MyClass &) noexcept;
        friend Qt::partial_ordering compareThreeWay(const MyClass &, const MyClass &) noexcept;
        Q_DECLARE_PARTIALLY_ORDERED(MyClass)
    };
    \endcode

    When compiled with C++17, the macro will expand into the following code:

    \code
    // operator==() and operator!=() are generated from
    // Q_DECLARE_EQUALITY_COMPARABLE
    friend bool operator<(const MyClass &lhs, const MyClass &rhs) noexcept
    {

    }
    friend bool operator>=(const MyClass &lhs, const MyClass &rhs) noexcept
    {
        // inline implementation which uses compareThreeWay()
    }
    \endcode

    When compiled with C++20, the macro will expand into \c {operator==()} and

    \code
    friend bool operator==(const MyClass &lhs, const MyClass &rhs) noexcept

    friend std::partial_ordering
    operator<=>(const MyClass &lhs, const MyClass &rhs) noexcept
    {
        // inline implementation which uses compareThreeWay()
    }
    \endcode

    The \c {*_LITERAL_TYPE} versions of the macros are used to generate
    \c constexpr operators. This means that the helper \c {comparesEqual()} and
    \c {compareThreeWay()} functions must also be \c constexpr.

    Consider the following example of a mixed-type \c constexpr comparison
    operators declaration:

    \code
    class MyClass {
        ...
    private:

        Q_DECLARE_PARTIALLY_ORDERED_LITERAL_TYPE(MyClass, int)
    };
    \endcode

    When compiled with C++17, the macro will expand into the following code:

    \code
    // operator==(), operator!=(), and their reversed versions are generated
    // from Q_DECLARE_EQUALITY_COMPARABLE_LITERAL_TYPE
    friend constexpr bool operator<(const MyClass &lhs, int rhs) noexcept
