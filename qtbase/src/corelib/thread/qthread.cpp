    \class QThread
    \inmodule QtCore
    \brief The QThread class provides a platform-independent way to
    manage threads.

    \ingroup thread

    A QThread object manages one thread of control within the
    program. QThreads begin executing in run(). By default, run() starts the
    event loop by calling exec() and runs a Qt event loop inside the thread.

    You can use worker objects by moving them to the thread using
    QObject::moveToThread().

    \snippet code/src_corelib_thread_qthread.cpp worker

    The code inside the Worker's slot would then execute in a
    separate thread. However, you are free to connect the
    Worker's slots to any signal, from any object, in any thread. It
    is safe to connect signals and slots across different threads,
    thanks to a mechanism called \l{Qt::QueuedConnection}{queued
    connections}.

    Another way to make code run in a separate thread, is to subclass QThread
    and reimplement run(). For example:

    \snippet code/src_corelib_thread_qthread.cpp reimpl-run

    In that example, the thread will exit after the run function has returned.
    There will not be any event loop running in the thread unless you call
    exec().

    It is important to remember that a QThread instance \l{QObject#Thread
    Affinity}{lives in} the old thread that instantiated it, not in the
    new thread that calls run(). This means that all of QThread's queued
    slots and \l {QMetaObject::invokeMethod()}{invoked methods} will execute
    in the old thread. Thus, a developer who wishes to invoke slots in the
    new thread must use the worker-object approach; new slots should not be
    implemented directly into a subclassed QThread.

    Unlike queued slots or invoked methods, methods called directly on the
    QThread object will execute in the thread that calls the method. When
    subclassing QThread, keep in mind that the constructor executes in the
    old thread while run() executes in the new thread. If a member variable
    is accessed from both functions, then the variable is accessed from two
    different threads. Check that it is safe to do so.

    \note Care must be taken when interacting with objects across different
    threads. As a general rule, functions can only be called from the thread
    that created the QThread object itself (e.g. setPriority()), unless the
    documentation says otherwise. See \l{Synchronizing Threads} for details.

    \section1 Managing Threads

    QThread will notify you via a signal when the thread is
    started() and finished(), or you can use isFinished() and
    isRunning() to query the state of the thread.

    You can stop the thread by calling exit() or quit(). In extreme
    cases, you may want to forcibly terminate() an executing thread.
    However, doing so is dangerous and discouraged. Please read the
    documentation for terminate() and setTerminationEnabled() for
    detailed information.

    You often want to deallocate objects that live in a thread when
    a thread ends. To do this, connect the finished() signal to
    QObject::deleteLater().

    Use wait() to block the calling thread, until the other thread
    has finished execution (or until a specified time has passed).

    QThread also provides static, platform independent sleep
    functions: sleep(), msleep(), and usleep() allow full second,
    millisecond, and microsecond resolution respectively.

    \note wait() and the sleep() functions should be unnecessary in
    general, since Qt is an event-driven framework. Instead of
    wait(), consider listening for the finished() signal. Instead of
    the sleep() functions, consider using QTimer.

    The static functions currentThreadId() and currentThread() return
    identifiers for the currently executing thread. The former
    returns a platform specific ID for the thread; the latter returns
    a QThread pointer.

    To choose the name that your thread will be given (as identified
    by the command \c{ps -L} on Linux, for example), you can call
    \l{QObject::setObjectName()}{setObjectName()} before starting the thread.
    If you don't call \l{QObject::setObjectName()}{setObjectName()},
    the name given to your thread will be the class name of the runtime
    type of your thread object (for example, \c "RenderThread" in the case of the
    \l{Mandelbrot} example, as that is the name of the QThread subclass).
    Note that this is currently not available with release builds on Windows.

        {Producer and Consumer using Wait Conditions}

/*!
    \fn Qt::HANDLE QThread::currentThreadId()

    Returns the thread handle of the currently executing thread.

    \warning The handle returned by this function is used for internal
    purposes and should not be used in any application code.

    \note On Windows, this function returns the DWORD (Windows-Thread
    ID) returned by the Win32 function GetCurrentThreadId(), not the pseudo-HANDLE
    (Windows-Thread HANDLE) returned by the Win32 function GetCurrentThread().
*/

/*!
    \fn int QThread::idealThreadCount()

    Returns the ideal number of threads that this process can run in parallel.
    This is done by querying the number of logical processors available to this
    process (if supported by this OS) or the total number of logical processors
    in the system. This function returns 1 if neither value could be
    determined.

    \note On operating systems that support setting a thread's affinity to a
    subset of all logical processors, the value returned by this function may
    change between threads and over time.

    \note On operating systems that support CPU hotplugging and hot-unplugging,
    the value returned by this function may also change over time (and note
    that CPUs can be turned on and off by software, without a physical,
    hardware change).
*/

/*!
    \fn void QThread::yieldCurrentThread()

    Yields execution of the current thread to another runnable thread,
    if any. Note that the operating system decides to which thread to
    switch.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QThread::start(Priority priority)

    Begins execution of the thread by calling run(). The
    operating system will schedule the thread according to the \a
    priority parameter. If the thread is already running, this
    function does nothing.

    The effect of the \a priority parameter is dependent on the
    operating system's scheduling policy. In particular, the \a priority
    will be ignored on systems that do not support thread priorities
    (such as on Linux, see the
    \l {http://linux.die.net/man/2/sched_setscheduler}{sched_setscheduler}
    documentation for more details).

/*!
    \fn void QThread::finished()

    This signal is emitted from the associated thread right before it finishes executing.

    When this signal is emitted, the event loop has already stopped running.
    No more events will be processed in the thread, except for deferred deletion events.
    This signal can be connected to QObject::deleteLater(), to free objects in that thread.

    \note If the associated thread was terminated using terminate(), it is undefined from
    which thread this signal is emitted.

    \sa started()
*/

/*!
    \enum QThread::Priority

    This enum type indicates how the operating system should schedule
    newly created threads.

    \value IdlePriority scheduled only when no other threads are
           running.

    \value LowestPriority scheduled less often than LowPriority.
    \value LowPriority scheduled less often than NormalPriority.

    \value NormalPriority the default priority of the operating
           system.

    \value HighPriority scheduled more often than NormalPriority.

/*!
    \fn void QThread::terminate()
    \threadsafe

    Terminates the execution of the thread. The thread may or may not
    be terminated immediately, depending on the operating system's
    scheduling policies. Use QThread::wait() after terminate(), to be
    sure.

    When the thread is terminated, all threads waiting for the thread
    to finish will be woken up.

    \warning This function is dangerous and its use is discouraged.
    The thread can be terminated at any point in its code path.
    Threads can be terminated while modifying data. There is no
    chance for the thread to clean up after itself, unlock any held
    mutexes, etc. In short, use this function only if absolutely
    necessary.

    Termination can be explicitly enabled or disabled by calling
    QThread::setTerminationEnabled(). Calling this function while
    termination is disabled results in the termination being
    deferred, until termination is re-enabled. See the documentation
    of QThread::setTerminationEnabled() for more information.

    Blocks the thread until either of these conditions is met:

    \li The thread associated with this QThread object has finished
       execution (i.e. when it returns from \l{run()}). This function
       will return true if the thread has finished. It also returns
       true if the thread has not been started yet.
    \li The \a deadline is reached. This function will return false if the
       deadline is reached.
    \endlist

    A deadline timer set to \c QDeadlineTimer::Forever (the default) will never
    time out: in this case, the function only returns when the thread returns
    from \l{run()} or if the thread has not yet started.

    This provides similar functionality to the POSIX \c
    pthread_join() function.

/*!
    \fn void QThread::setTerminationEnabled(bool enabled)

    Enables or disables termination of the current thread based on the

    QThread.

    When \a enabled is false, termination is disabled.  Future calls
    to QThread::terminate() will return immediately without effect.
    Instead, the termination is deferred until termination is enabled.

    When \a enabled is true, termination is enabled.  Future calls to
    QThread::terminate() will terminate the thread normally.  If
    termination has been deferred (i.e. QThread::terminate() was
    called with termination disabled), this function will terminate
    the calling thread \e immediately.  Note that this function will
    not return in this case.
