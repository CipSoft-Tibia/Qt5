\note Disconnecting all signal-slot connections will also disconnect the
\l QObject::destroyed() signal if it is connected. Doing so can adversely
affect classes that rely on this signal for cleaning up resources. It is
recommended to disconnect only the specific signals that were connected by
application code.
