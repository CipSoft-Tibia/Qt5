Streams \a object into a QDebug instance that operates on a string,
and then returns that string.

This function is useful for cases where you need the textual representation
of an object for debugging, but cannot use \c {operator<<}. For example:

\snippet code/src_corelib_io_qdebug.cpp toString

The string is streamed using \l nospace().
