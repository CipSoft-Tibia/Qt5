This file is closed before it is copied.

If the copied file is a symbolic link (symlink), the
file it refers to is copied, not the link itself. With the
exception of permissions, which are copied, no other file metadata
is copied.

Returns \c true if successful; otherwise returns \c false.

Note that if a file with the name \a newName already exists,
copy() returns \c false. This means QFile will not overwrite it.
