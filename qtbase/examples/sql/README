Qt provides extensive database interoperability, with support for products
from both open source and proprietary vendors.

SQL support is integrated with Qt's model/view architecture, making it easier
to provide GUI integration for your database applications.


Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
