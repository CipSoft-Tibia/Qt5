Qt provides powerful document-oriented rich text engine that supports Unicode
and right-to-left scripts. Documents can be manipulated using a cursor-based
API, and their contents can be imported and exported as both HTML and in a
custom XML format.

Text is rendered using anti-aliased outline fonts to provide the best
possible on-screen representation.


Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
