The animation framework aims to provide an easy way for creating animated and
smooth GUI's. By animating Qt properties, the framework provides great freedom
for animating widgets and other QObjects. The framework can also be used with
the Graphics View framework.


Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
