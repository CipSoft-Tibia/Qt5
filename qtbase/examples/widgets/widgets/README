Qt comes with a large range of standard widgets that users of modern
applications have come to expect.

You can also develop your own custom widgets and controls, and use them
alongside standard widgets.

It is even possible to provide custom styles and themes for widgets that can
be used to change the appearance of standard widgets and appropriately
written custom widgets.


Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
