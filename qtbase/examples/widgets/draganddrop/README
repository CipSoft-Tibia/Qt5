Qt supports native drag and drop on all platforms via an extensible
MIME-based system that enables applications to send data to each other in the
most appropriate formats.

Drag and drop can also be implemented for internal use by applications.


Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
