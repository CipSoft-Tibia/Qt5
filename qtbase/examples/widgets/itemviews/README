Item views are widgets that typically display data sets. Qt 4's model/view
framework lets you handle large data sets by separating the underlying data
from the way it is represented to the user, and provides support for
customized rendering through the use of delegates.


Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
