Qt provides features to enable applications to integrate with the user's
preferred desktop environment.

Features such as system tray icons, access to the desktop widget, and
support for desktop services can be used to improve the appearance of
applications and take advantage of underlying desktop facilities.


Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
