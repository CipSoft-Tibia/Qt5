    \brief Demonstrates how Composition Modes work in QPainter.

    \brief This demo shows some of the more advanced composition modes supported by Qt.

    \image composition-demo.png

    The two most common forms of composition are \b{Source} and \b{SourceOver}.
    \b{Source} is used to draw opaque objects onto a paint device. In this mode,
    each pixel in the source replaces the corresponding pixel in the destination.
    In \b{SourceOver} composition mode, the source object is transparent and is
    drawn on top of the destination.

    In addition to these standard modes, Qt defines the complete set of composition modes
    as defined by T. Porter and T. Duff. See the QPainter documentation for details.
