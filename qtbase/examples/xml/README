XML parsing and handling is supported through SAX and DOM compliant APIs.

Qt's SAX compliant classes allow you to parse XML incrementally; the DOM
classes enable more complex document-level operations to be performed on
XML files.


Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
