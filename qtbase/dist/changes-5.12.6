 - QLocale:
   * The system locale's UI languages list now includes, as for that of an
     ordinary locale, the results of adding likely sub-tags from each
     locale name, and of removing some, where this doesn't change which
     locale is specified. This gives searches for translation files a
     better chance of finding a suitable file.
