 - Fixed a bug that made qErrnoWarning() say there was no error when
   generating the error message.

 - QBitArray:
   * Fixed two bugs that caused QBitArrays created using fromBits() not to
     compare equal to the equivalent QBitArray created using other methods
     if the size was zero or not a multiple of 4. If the size modulus 8 was
     5, 6, or 7, the data was actually incorrect.

 - QCryptographicHash:
   * Fixed a bug that caused the SHA-3 and Keccak algorithms to crash if
     passed 256 MB of data or more.

 - QObject:
   * Fixed a resource leak caused by a race condition if multiple QObjects
     were created at the same time, for the first time in an application,
     from multiple threads (implies threads not started with QThread).

 - Linux:
   * [QTBUG-61916] Added an environment variable
     QT_QPA_PRESERVE_CONSOLE_STATE that can be used to prevent Qt from
     altering the tty screen and cursor settings when running with
     platforms like linuxfb and eglfs.

 - Android:
   * [QTBUG-76036] Fixed an issue where menus would not work on 64 bit
     builds.
