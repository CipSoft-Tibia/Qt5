Qt 4.4.3 is a rebranding-only release. In all other aspects, it is the
same release as Qt 4.4.2. It maintains both forward and backward
compatibility (source and binary) with Qt 4.4.2, 4.4.1 and 4.4.0.

The Qt version 4.4 series is binary compatible with the 4.3.x series.
The Qt for Embedded Linux version 4.4 series is binary compatible with
the Qtopia Core 4.3.x series. Applications compiled for 4.0, 4.1, 4.2,
and 4.3 will continue to run with 4.4.
