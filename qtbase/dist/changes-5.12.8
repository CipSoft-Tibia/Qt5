 - QLockFile:
   * Suppressed the warning on QNX that said 'setNativeLocks failed:
     "Function not implemented"'. There is no difference in behavior: Qt
     will continue not to be able to apply an OS- level file lock, which
     means the lock could be accidentally stolen by buggy software. Correct
     software using QLockFile should not be affected.

 - QXmlStream:
   * QTBUG-47417: QXmlStreamReader does now limit the expansion of
     entities to 4096 characters. Documents where a single entity
     expands to more characters than the limit are not considered well
     formed. The limit is there to avoid DoS attacks through
     recursively expanding entities when loading untrusted content. Qt
     5.15 will add methods that allow changing that limit.
