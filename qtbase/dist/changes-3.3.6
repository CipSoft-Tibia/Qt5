Platforms
---------

- It is now possible to build Qt 3.3.6 on Intel Macs. A universal
  Qt build however requires manual work by 'lipo'-ing a PPC Qt
  and an Intel Qt together.

Compilers
---------

- The build key when building Qt with gcc 4.x has changed. This means
  you will have to either recompile your plugins or change the configure
  script to not reduce the gcc version string to '4'.


Translations
------------

Various Qt translations contributed by Novell.
