 - [oss-fuzz-24347] QXmlStreamReader: No longer resizes readBuffer to a size
   it already has. When resizing it to 0 it will cause it to allocate memory.
   This will then cause append() to copy the data from the other string instead
   of using copy on write.
 - [oss-fuzz-24702] QTextHtmlParserNode: Fixed an integer-overflow in variantHash() due
   to extreme values for the font's pixelsize.
 - [QTBUG-86702] Gif decoder: fixed a read error caused by a ub check
   The recently added check to avoid negative-bitshift ub ignored that
   the algorithm will sometimes use a negative bitcount value as a flag.
   This caused a reading failure for some frames.
 - [QTBUG-86547] Fixed a double deletion in QDomAttr::setNodeValue()
 - [QTBUG-86691] xpm handler: fixed read error caused by off-by-one in overflow check
   The recently introduced overflow check for 8 bit images was too
   aggressive, causing the last pixel on each line to be rejected. This is also
   fixed for 32bit images.
 - [oss-fuzz-22997] Avoided a potential ub in a corrupt bmp file
 - [QTBUG-85725] Cocoa: Translated the buttons used for the native font and
   color dialogs
 - [QTBUG-86019] Fixed crash when serializing default-constructed QTimeZone
 - [oss-fuzz-24273] QBezier: No longer calculates a unit vector when length is null to
   prevent a divide by zero.
 - [QTBUG-81723] xcb: Fixed flushing of native subwindows when not using shared memory
   When using X-forwarding shared memory is not used for the backing
   store image, and ended up in a code path where we first copied the updated
   parts of the backing store from our client side image over to the
   server, and then flush those parts from the server-side image to the
   window.
 - [QTBUG-85764] Fixed starting of iOS applications on Big Sur
 - [QTBUG-85580] QByteArray::toDouble: fixed buffer overflow reads on fromRawData()
 - [QTBUG-85193] Allowed smooth curve stroking for very wide lines to ensure they
   are rendered better.
 - [QTBUG-85915] macOS: Fixed crash when re-using the backing store for a
   re-created QWindow. This was triggered when reopening a QComboBox after
   switching from one screen to another.
 - [oss-fuzz-23220] Sanitized the lengthValue in CSS parser by limiting the
   LengthData to the integer range before rounding it, taking into account
   that qRound() substracts 1 from negative values.
 - [oss-fuzz-21860] Checked return values of hex2int in get_hex_rgb
 - [oss-fuzz-23988] Fixed buffer overflow
 - [oss-fuzz-23735] Multiplied instead of shifting for negative values
 - [QTBUG-85528] Disabled PCRE2 JIT on macOS ARM64
 - [QTBUG-85279] macOS: Excluded 32-bit builds by checking pointer size
 - [QTBUG-85279] Fixed compilation of Qt on Apple Silicon (arm64)
 - [QTBUG-76924] Prevented the setting of focus on a proxy widget that does
   not take focus
 - [QTBUG-71548] Worked around a regression in the MSVC 2019 6.6 STL triggered
   when building qttranslations.
 - [QTBUG-84383] Fixed UITouch event handling on tvOS to prevent a crash
   when touchesEnd: could be called with touches that were not included in
   touchesBegain:.
 - [QTBUG-84762] macOS: Ensured QCocoaGLContext cleans up more often to
   release unneeded NSViews
 - [QTBUG-77320] Android: Accessibility is now activated when appropriate
 - [QTCREATORBUG-24195] Now always shows a submenu on its parent menu's screen
