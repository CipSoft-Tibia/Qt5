1. cacert.pem is, obviously, a root CA certificate.
2. test-intermediate-ca-cert.pem is a certificate, signed by the root CA, an intermediate CA.
3. test-intermediate-is-ca-cert.pem is a certificate, signed by test-intermediate-ca-cert.pem.
4. test-ocsp-good-cert.pem is signed by root CA, it has CA:FALSE but keyUsage allowing to sign
   CSRs - this is how OpenSSL would report us 'invalid CA certificate' instead of 'No issuer found'.
5. test-intermediate-not-ca-cert.pem is signed by test-ocsp-good-cert.pem.
