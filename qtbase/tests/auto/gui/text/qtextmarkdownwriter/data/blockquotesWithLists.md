What if we have a quotation containing a list?

> First some quoted text, and then a list:
> 
> - one
> - two is longer and has enough words to form a paragraph with text continuing
>   onto the next line
> 
> enough of that, let's try a numbered list
> 
> 1.  List item one
> 2.  List item two is longer and has enough words to form a paragraph with
>     text continuing onto the next line.
