Warning: Do NOT regenerate the .qsb files without proper planning and understanding
the following.

Among other things, we are also testing backwards compatibility for QShader
deserialization.

.qsb files with _v1 in the name were produced with an older qtshadertools
and have a QSB_VERSION of 1.

Files with _v2 are generated with a newer qsb, those have QSB_VERSION 2.
The difference is the support for nativeResourceBindingMap() which is only
present in v2.

Files with _v3 come from an even newer qsb, and have QSB_VERSION 3. The
difference to 2 is the use of CBOR instead of binary JSON for QShaderDescription.
