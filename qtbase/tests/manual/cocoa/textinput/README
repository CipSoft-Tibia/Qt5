# Debug keyboard layout

The keyboard layout in this directory can be enabled by
copying it to "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/" and adding it
it as an input source in the macOS keyboard preferences.

The layout was created in Ukulele and tries to cover many
corner cases of keyboard input related to e.g. modifier
and dead key states.
