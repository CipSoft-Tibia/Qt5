   \title Demo iOS Classes
   \brief IOS classes are used in the purchasing demo to enable purchasing in iOS.

   \section1 Classes
   \table
      \row
         \li \l IosInAppPurchaseProduct
         \li A product registered in the store.
      \row
         \li \l IosInAppPurchaseTransaction
         \li Contains information about a transaction in the external app store.
      \row
         \li \l IosInAppPurchaseBackend
         \li Comminucates with external store.

   Check out \l {Base Classes} which include InAppProduct, InAppStore,
   InAppTransaction and InAppPurchaseBackend

   \section1 IosInAppPurchaseProduct

   IosInAppPurchaseProduct adds purchase() for initializing purchasing process.

   \section1 IosInAppPurchaseTransaction

   IosInAppPurchaseTransaction adds new parameters and return types.
   Transaction error handling is implemented on IosInAppPurchaseTransaction's
   constructor. The class has the finalize() function that finalizes the transaction.

   \section1 IosInAppPurchaseBackend

   IosInAppPurchaseBackend uses \b Objective-C language to communicate with the App
   Store.

   \section2 Initializing the products

   This class shows the product's information on the store page.

   \list 1
      \li IosInAppPurchaseBackend is called from InAppStore::setupBackend().
      \li At initialization IosInAppPurchaseBackend creates InAppPurchaseManager with
         Objective-C.
      \li InAppStore::registerProduct(productType, &identifier) function is called and
         queryProduct() is executed in the back end.
      \li Objective-C function requestProductData:() is called and will make \l{https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skproductsrequest}{SKProductRequest}.
      \li After SKProductRequest is finished and product objects has been
         created in Objective-C productsRequest:(), products will be registered
         by the IosInAppPurchaseBackend::registerProduct() function.
      \li Signal productQueryDone() will be emitted and the item's information will be
         visible on the application's store page.
   \endlist

   \section2 Purchasing process

   \list 1
      \li The user presses one of the products on the applications store page.
      \li \c IosInAppPurchaseProduct::purchase() function is called and payment is added to
      the \c SKPaymentQueue in the Objective-C function paymentQueue:() in
      IosInAppPurchaseBackend.
      \li Purchase confirmation pop-up is launched for the user.
