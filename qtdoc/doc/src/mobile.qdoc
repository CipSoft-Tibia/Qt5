    \section1 Tools for Mobile Development

    \l{Qt Creator} is the IDE for Qt development. Qt Creator creates project
    files, test and debug code, and connects to mobile devices. For Android, Qt
    Creator can sign and package APK files, ready for publishing to Google Play.
    \l Xcode is necessary for development on Apple platforms and Qt Creator can
    create project files and connect to Apple devices for testing.

    \section2 Design Tools for Mobile
