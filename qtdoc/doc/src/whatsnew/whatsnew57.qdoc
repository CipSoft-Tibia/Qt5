     \endlist
    \endlist

    \section1 New Features in Qt 5.7

    \section2 Qt 3D Module
    \list
     \li Added support for Compute Shaders on supported hardware.
     \li Added support for loading multi-image DDS and KTX textures including
         cubemaps, mip chains, and array textures.
     \li Improved support for compressed texture formats.
     \li Made Render surface explicit.
     \li Extended Input API and support for device plugins.
     \li Improved picking support.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Core Module
    \list
        \li Added \c qAsConst function to help using non-const Qt containers in
            C++11 range for loops.
        \li Enabled Qt event dispatchers to use the \c poll() function on Unix
            now, making it possible for applications to have file
            descriptors greater than 1024.
        \li Added support for converting a floating point to its shortest and
            exact string form, without having to pre-calculate the number of
            digits.
        \li Improved C++11 support by using \c std::atomic as backend for
            QAtomic classes and adding QTypeInfo for \c char16_t and
            \c char32_t.
        \li Added QIODevice support for multi-streaming.
        \li Enabled QPluginLoader to work even if \c QT_NO_LIBRARY is set (for
            example, linking against a static libc).
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Canvas3D Module
    \list
        \li Upgraded the \e three.js 3rd party library.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt GUI Module
    \list
        \li Optimized QImage smooth scaling for NEON.
        \li Optimized the OpenGL function wrappers for speed and code size.
            The QtGui library size has been significantly reduced due to a
            massive reduction in symbols.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Multimedia Module
    \list
        \li Added support for tvOS.
        \li Extended QML playlist API.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Platform Abstraction (QPA)
    \list
        \li Added support for NVIDIA DRIVE CX boards (Tegra X1, AArch64).
        \li Improved support for theming with \e eglfs.
        \li Enabled QMenuBar to use the unified D-Bus AppMenu menubar on
            supported X11-based desktop environments such as Ubuntu Unity.
        \li Added support for creating Android services.

    \section2 Qt QML Module
    \list
        \li Added JIT support for WinRT on x86 and x64.
        \li Enabled JIT for 64-bit ARM Linux platforms.
        \li Enabled all debug services to work with QJSEngine
            (instead of QQmlEngine), which allows non-QML JavaScript
            debugging or profiling.
        \li Added support for debugging multiple QJSEngine instances at the same
            time.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Quick Module
    \list
        \li Added support for all subclasses of QQuickWindow by the inspector
            service, which makes Qt Creator's inspection feature useful.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt WebEngine Module

    \list
        \li Upgraded to Chromium 49 release.
        \li Added support for drag and drop, and printing to PDF.
        \li Added tab notification for audio being played.
        \li Added support for playing DRM-protected HTML5 video using Widevine
            Pepper plugin.

            secure and isolated JavaScript worlds.
        \li Improved support for custom context menus.
