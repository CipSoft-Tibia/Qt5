\title Building Qt Sources
\brief Building Qt from the source packages

There are two ways to install Qt:
\list 1
\li through the \e {Qt Installers} - downloads and installs Qt
\li through the \e{Qt sources}
\endlist

\note Add the Qt build directory to the list of excluded directories
      of any anti-virus application that runs on your system.

You can download the Qt installers and sources from the \l Downloads page.
For more information, visit the \l{Getting Started with Qt} page.

This page lists the relevant information for installing Qt by building the Qt
sources. The installation procedure is different on each Qt platform. This page
collects the relevant information for the \l{Supported Platforms}
{supported platforms}. In addition, this page provides links to any
module-specific system requirements.

\section1 General Installation Information

To build Qt from source, use \c configure to configure Qt for a particular
platform with a particular set of Qt features or modules. For more information,
visit the following page:

\li \l{Qt Configure Options}

\endlist

\section1 Additional Information

The top-level qt5 Git repository contains a set of build instructions in the
form of \e {provisioning scripts}, used by Qt's continuous integration (CI)
system to build and test the \l {Supported Platforms}. These
scripts are useful for anyone building Qt from source, as they provide
information on the tools and components that are required for each
configuration.
