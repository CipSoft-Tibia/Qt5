    \brief Qt solutions for developer use cases.

    As a developer, you most likely have a favorite operating system, toolchain,
    and language. At work, the choices might be made for you, but Qt gives you
    some freedom by enabling you to maintain a single software code base across
    all operating systems, platforms, and screen types, from desktops and
    embedded systems to business-critical applications, in-vehicle systems,
    wearables, and mobile devices connected to the Internet of Things.

    The options are endless, but the following table summarizes the solutions
    available for different types of target platforms or industries with links
    to more information.

    \table
    \header
        \li To Develop For
        \li You Need
    \row
        \li Desktop
        \li Qt for Linux, \macos, or Windows with the appropriate
            \l{All Modules}{Qt modules}, depending on what your
            applications will be used for.
    \row
        \li Mobile Devices
        \li Qt for Linux, \macos, or Windows and for the mobile device
            platform that you want to run the applications on. For example,
            \l{Qt for Android} or \l{Qt for iOS}.
    \row
        \li Embedded Devices
        \li \l {Boot to Qt}, \l {Qt for Android Automotive}, or
            \l {Qt for Automation}.
    \row
        \li MCUs
        \li \l{Qt for MCUs}
    \endtable

    You can use C++, QML, or Python for application development:

    \table
    \header
        \li To Develop With
        \li You Need
    \row
        \li C++/Qt
        \li Qt for Linux, \macos, or Windows
    \row
        \li QML/Qt Quick
        \li Qt for Linux, \macos, or Windows
    \row
        \li Python
        \li \l{Qt for Python}
    \endtable

    \list
        \li \l{Get and Install Qt}
            {I want to install the necessary tools and modules}
        \li \l{Create Your First Applications}
            {I've already installed everything and want to start developing}
    \endlist
