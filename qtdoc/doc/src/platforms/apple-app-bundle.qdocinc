//! [building an app bundle]
     To build your application as an application bundle with CMake, set the
     \l {https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/MACOSX_BUNDLE.html}
     {\c {MACOSX_BUNDLE}} property on your executable target, as follows:

     \badcode
     qt_add_executable(app)
     if(APPLE)
         set_target_properties(tst_manual_ios_assets PROPERTIES MACOSX_BUNDLE TRUE)
     endif()
     \endcode

    With qmake, bundles are the default. Set \c {CONFIG -= app_bundle} in your project
    file (\c{.pro}) to disable it.
