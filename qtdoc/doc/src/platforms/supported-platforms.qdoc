    \title Supported Platforms
    \brief The platforms supported by Qt.

    Qt is a commercial and open source licensed cross-platform application
    and UI framework. It is developed by The Qt Company, together with the
    Qt Project Community under an open source governance model.

    Using Qt, you can write GUI applications once and deploy them
    across desktop, mobile and embedded operating systems without
    rewriting the source code.

    Qt is supported on a variety of 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, and can usually
    be built on each platform with GCC, a vendor-supplied compiler, or a third
    party compiler as indicated in the overview below.

    Open GL (ES) 2.0, DirectX 9 or 11 (with ANGLE), or an \l {Qt Quick 2D Renderer} {alternative
    renderer} is required for \l [QtQuick] {Qt Quick} 2.
    \l [QtWidgets] {Qt Widgets}{Widgets} can be used without
    hardware acceleration.

    In Qt 5 all platforms are created using the \l{Qt Platform Abstraction}
    (QPA), which makes it easy to port Qt into a new operating system.

    The following platforms are supported in Qt \qtver. For support information
    for prior Qt releases, please consult the relevant version in the
    \l {http://doc.qt.io/archives/}{Qt Documentation Archives}.

    Configurations in \b bold are \l {Reference Configurations}.

    \include supported-platforms.qdocinc all

    \section1 Reference Configurations

    The reference configurations are run on the continuous integration (CI)
    system within Qt Project. In addition, they are subjected to unit test suite
    and other internal testing tools on a frequent basis (prior to new version
    releases, source tree branching, and at other significant period points in
    the development process). Errors or bugs discovered in these platforms are
    prioritized for correction. Significant errors discovered in tested
    configurations can impact release dates.

    Any configurations not listed above are not actively tested by the Qt
    Project. However, Qt may run on configurations other than those actively
    tested on, and additional configurations may be raised to tested state, if
    sufficient effort is made to bring continuous integration to an acceptable
    state for that particular configuration.

    The Qt Company, Qt partners, open source projects and community users
    are able to provide assistance with various different supported
    platforms and configurations.

    \section1 Availability of Packages

    You can download the Qt 5 installers and source packages from the \l Downloads page.
    For more information, visit the \l{Getting Started with Qt} page.

    \section2 Exceptions
    Individual modules might be available only on some platforms, or they might
    not support all configurations. For example, as Qt \WebEngine has Chromium
    as a third-party dependency, platform or configuration limitations upstream
    also apply to Qt \WebEngine.

    The documentation for each module contains detailed information about any
    exceptions the module has from the general platform and configuration
    support as described on this page.

    \section1 Deployment of Qt Applications

    The deployment procedure for each platform is different and they are
    covered in greater detail in their platform pages. Meanwhile, there is a
    deployment article for summarizing the deployment procedure in general.
    \list
    \li \l{Deploying Qt Applications}
        \list
            \li \l{Platform and Compiler Notes - Android#Deployment}{Android}
            \li \l{Qt for iOS}{iOS}
            \li \l{Qt for Linux/X11 - Deployment}{Linux/X11}
            \li \l{Qt for macOS - Deployment}{\macos}
            \li \l{Qt for Windows - Deployment}{Windows}
        \endlist
    \endlist
