    \title Qt for Wayland Requirements
    \brief Setting up Wayland for Qt.

    To download and install Qt for Wayland, follow the instructions on the
    \l {Getting Started with Qt} page.

    Divide into two sections. One for runtime and one for build.

    \section1 Requirements for Development Host

    Ubuntu versions later than <insert version here> contains all necessary
    dependencies, so you dont' need to build Wayland yourself.

    The following packages are required:

    \list
        \li libwayland-dev
        \li libwayland-egl1-mesa
        \li libwayland-server0
        \li libgles2-mesa-dev
        \li libxkbcommon-dev
    \endlist
