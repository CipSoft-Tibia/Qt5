    \brief Platform support for INTEGRITY.

    From Qt 5.9 onwards, the Green Hills Software
    \l {http://www.ghs.com/products/rtos/integrity.html} {INTEGRITY}
    Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is a supported platform.

    The INTEGRITY RTOS is widely used in safety- and security-critical systems.
    Especially in the automotive industry, both Qt and the INTEGRITY RTOS can be
    used in conjunction with instrument clusters and infotainment systems.

    With Qt for INTEGRITY you can build and develop applications for the
    INTEGRITY RTOS. Qt for INTEGRITY supports most \l {Supported Qt Modules} {Qt Modules}.
    The development environment includes your target device and Qt sources
    that you need to build for your target device.
    See \l {Supported Development Hosts and Boards} for detailed information
    about the supported development environment.

    Qt for INTEGRITY has a tutorial that helps you learn how to:
    \list
        \li Set up a development environment for the i.MX6 Quad board
        \li Build an INTEGRITY application
        \li Prepare the i.MX6 Quad board to run your application
    \endlist

    See \l {Qt for INTEGRITY: Monolith Project Tutorial}.
