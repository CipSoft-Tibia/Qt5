\title Environment Variables Used by Qt for Android
\brief Lists some useful environment variables used by the Qt For Android toolchain.
\ingroup androidplatform

\section1 Enabling or disabling workarounds

Qt Android uses some environment variables to enable/disable certain workarounds:
\section2 Commonly used variables
\list
    \li QT_ANDROID_NO_EXIT_CALL: In some cases, an Android app might not be able
    to safely clean all threads while calling \c exit() and crash. This is because
    there are C++ threads running and destroying these without joining them
    terminates an application. These threads cannot be joined because it's not
    possible to know if they are running.
    This flag avoids calling \c exit() and lets the Android system handle this,
    at the cost of not attempting to run global destructors.
    \li QT_ANDROID_ENABLE_WORKAROUND_TO_DISABLE_PREDICTIVE_TEXT: Allows
    the hiding of predictive text suggestions, mainly from password fields. Certain
    devices donâ€™t handle this properly.
    \li QT_ANDROID_ENABLE_RIGHT_MOUSE_FROM_LONG_PRESS: Interprets a long touch press
    as a right mouse click event.
    \li QT_ANDROID_DISABLE_ACCESSIBILITY: Disable \l{Assistive Tools}{Accessibility}.
    This prevents the processing of accessibility events.
\endlist

\section2 Less commonly used variables
\list
    \li QT_ANDROID_FONT_LOCATION: Sets a custom path for system fonts.
    \li QT_ANDROID_MAX_ASSETS_CACHE_SIZE: cache size for assets under the
    assets folder.
    \li QT_ANDROID_DISABLE_GLYPH_CACHE_WORKAROUND
    \li QT_ANDROID_RASTER_IMAGE_DEPTH
    \li QT_ANDROID_MINIMUM_MOUSE_DOUBLE_CLICK_DISTANCE
\endlist

\note Though related, these are not the same as CMake commands or variables used
by Qt For Android, see \l{Qt for Android: CMake}
