\title Qt for Android Environment Variables
\brief Lists some useful environment variables used by the Qt For Android toolchain.
\ingroup android-platform-extra-topics

\section1 Enabling or disabling workarounds

Qt Android uses some environment variables to enable/disable certain workarounds:

\section2 Commonly used variables

\table 80%
\header \li Variable \li Description
\row
    \li QT_ANDROID_NO_EXIT_CALL
    \li In some cases, an Android app might not be able to safely clean all
    threads while calling \c exit() and it might crash. This is because there
    are C++ threads running and destroying these without joining them terminates
    an application. These threads cannot be joined because it's not possible
    to know if they are running. This flag avoids calling \c exit() and lets
    the Android system handle this, at the cost of not attempting to run
    global destructors.
\row
    \li QT_ANDROID_ENABLE_WORKAROUND_TO_DISABLE_PREDICTIVE_TEXT
    \li Allows the hiding of predictive text suggestions, mainly from password
    fields. Certain devices donâ€™t handle this properly. For more information,
    see \l {Android Platform Notes}{Predictive Text}.
\row
    \li QT_ANDROID_ENABLE_RIGHT_MOUSE_FROM_LONG_PRESS
    \li Interprets a long touch press as a right mouse click event.
\row
    \li QT_ANDROID_DISABLE_ACCESSIBILITY
    \li Disable \l{Assistive Tools}{Accessibility}. This prevents the processing
    of accessibility events.
\endtable

\section2 Less commonly used variables

\table 80%
\header \li Variable \li Description
\row
    \li QT_ANDROID_FONT_LOCATION
    \li Sets a custom path for system fonts.
\row
    \li QT_ANDROID_MAX_ASSETS_CACHE_SIZE
    \li Cache size for assets under the assets folder.
\row
    \li QT_ANDROID_DISABLE_GLYPH_CACHE_WORKAROUND
    \li See \l{Text Glyph Caching}{Text Glyph Caching}
\row
    \li QT_ANDROID_RASTER_IMAGE_DEPTH
    \li
\row
    \li QT_ANDROID_MINIMUM_MOUSE_DOUBLE_CLICK_DISTANCE
    \li
\endtable

by Qt For Android, see \l{Qt for Android CMake Configuration}
