    \title The QtEntryPoint Library
    \ingroup licensing
    \brief Commercial and \l{BSD 3-clause "New" or "Revised" License}.

    \e QtEntryPoint is a helper library that enables the developer to
    write a cross-platform main() function on Windows.
    If you do not use \l {Build with CMake}{CMake}, \l qmake,
    \l {Qbs Manual}{qbs}, or any other build tool that handles this
    automatically, then you need to link against the
    \c QtEntryPoint library.

    The entry point library is statically linked with the application.
    To avoid issues with static linking and the
    \l{GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)},
    it is licensed both under the commercial licenses,
    and the \l{BSD 3-clause "New" or "Revised" License}.

    available as COM servers on Windows.

    The two Active Qt libraries available are statically linked with
    the application.
