    \title Resource Compiler (rcc)
    \ingroup qttools
    \keyword rcc

    The \c rcc tool is used to embed resources into a Qt application during
    the build process. It works by generating a C++ source file containing
    data specified in a Qt resource (.qrc) file.

    Usage:
    \snippet snippets/code/doc_src_rcc.qdoc 0

    RCC accepts the following command line options:

    \table
    \header \li Option         \li Argument \li Description

    \row \li \c{-o} \li \c{file} \li Write output to \c{file} rather than to stdout.

    \row \li \c{-name} \li \c{name} \li Create an external initialization
                                     function with \c{name}.

    \row \li \c{-threshold} \li \c{level} \li Specifies a threshold \c{level} (as a
                           percentage) to use when deciding whether to compress
                           a file. If the reduction in the file size is greater than
                           the threshold \c{level}, it is compressed; otherwise,
                           the uncompressed data is stored instead. The default
                           threshold level is 70%, meaning that compressed files
                           which are 30% or less of their original size are
                           stored as compressed data.

    \row \li \c{-compress} \li \c{level} \li Compress input files to the given
                                          compression \c{level}, which is an
                                          integer in the range 1 to 9. Level 1
                                          does the least compression but is
                                          fastest. Level 9 does the most
                                          compression but is slowest. To turn
                                          off compression, use \c{-no-compress}.
                                          The default value for \c{level} is -1,
                                          which means use zlib's default
                                          compression level.

    \row \li \c{-root} \li \c{path} \li Prefix the resource access path with \c{path}.
                                     The default is no prefix.

    \row \li \c{-no-compress} \li \li Disable compression.

    \row \li \c{-binary} \li \li Output a binary file for use as a dynamic resource.

    \row \li \c{-version} \li \li Display version information.

    \row \li \c{-help} \li \li Display usage information.

    \row \li \c{-t, --temp <file>} \li \li Use temporary <file> for big resources.

    \row \li \c{--namespace} \li \li Turn off namespace macros.

    \row \li \c{--verbose} \li \li Enable verbose mode.

    \row \li \c{--list} \li \li Only list .qrc file entries, do not generate code.

    \row \li \c{-project} \li \li Output a resource file containing all files from the
                                  current directory.
