\title QML Applications
\brief Essential documentation for QML application developers
\ingroup explanations-programminglanguages

QML is a declarative language that allows user interfaces to be described in
terms of their visual components and how they interact and relate with one
another.  It is a highly readable language that was designed to enable
components to be interconnected in a dynamic manner, and it allows components to
be easily reused and customized within a user interface.  Using the \c QtQuick
module, designers and developers can easily build fluid animated user interfaces
in QML, and have the option of connecting these user interfaces to any back-end
C++ libraries.


\section1 What is QML?

QML is a user interface specification and programming language.
It allows developers and designers alike to create highly performant, fluidly
animated and visually appealing applications.  QML offers a highly readable,
declarative, JSON-like syntax with support for imperative JavaScript
expressions combined with dynamic property bindings.

\snippet qmlapp/qml_overview.qml file

The QML language and engine infrastructure is provided by the \l {Qt QML} module.
For in-depth information about the QML language, please see the
\l{Qt QML} module documentation.

\section1 What is Qt Quick?

Qt Quick is the standard library of QML types and functionality for QML. It
includes visual types, interactive types, animations, models and views,
particle effects and shader effects.  A QML application developer can get
access to all of that functionality with a single import statement.

The \c QtQuick QML library is provided by the \l{Qt Quick} module.
For in-depth information about the various QML types and other functionality
provided by Qt Quick, please see the \l{Qt Quick} module documentation.
Qt Quick adds visual types, animation types, and other QML types in addition to
the standard QML types from Qt QML.

\section2 Buttons, Menus, and other Controls

For a set of UI controls, the \l{Qt Quick Controls} module implements several
controls such as buttons, menus, and views. These controls come with
several built-in styles that can be used, and also support the creation
of custom styles.

\section1 Qt Quick Projects

\l{Qt Creator} sets up project environments for the following types of Qt Quick
applications:

\list
\li \b Scroll - scroll-based navigation
\li \b Stack - stack-based navigation
\li \b Swipe - page-based application with swipe navigation
\li \b Python - \l{Qt for Python} projects can have QML UIs and have Qt Creator
support
\endlist

\li \l{Design Tools} - tools for designing UIs
\endlist

\section1 Code Samples and Demos

To learn more about uses of QML code, there are several code samples which show
how QML types are used. In addition, there are several demos which show how
QML code is used in applications.
