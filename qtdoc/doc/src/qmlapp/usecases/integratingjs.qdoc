\title Use Case - Integrating JavaScript in QML
\brief Example of how to integrate JavaScript code in QML applications

JavaScript code can be easily integrated into QML to provide UI logic, imperative control, or other benefits.

\section1 Using JavaScript Expressions for Property Values

JavaScript expressions can be used in QML as bindings. For example:
\code
Item {
    width: Math.random()
    height: width < 100 ? 100 : (width + 50) /  2
}
\endcode

Note that function calls, like Math.random(), will not be reevaluated unless their arguments
change. So binding to Math.random() will be one random number and not reevaluated, but if the width is changed in some
other manner, the height binding will be reevaluated to take that into account.

\section1 Adding JavaScript Functions in QML

JavaScript functions can be declared on QML items, like in the below example. This allows you to call the method
using the item id.

\section1 Using JavaScript Files

JavaScript files can be used for abstracting out logic from QML files. To do this, first place your functions inside a
.js file like in the example shown.

Then import the file into any .qml file that needs to use the functions, like the example QML file below.

For further details on the JavaScript engine used by QML, as well as the difference from browser JS, see the full
documentation on \l {JavaScript Expressions in QML Documents}.
