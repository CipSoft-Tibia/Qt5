\title Porting C++ Applications to Qt 5
\brief Provides instructions to migrate a Qt 4 C++ application to Qt 5.

This topic talks about the Qt Widgets changes in Qt 5. The
following step-by-step instructions take you through the changes required to
port the \l{Animated Tiles Example}{Animated Tiles} application to Qt 5:

\list 1
   \li Open the Animated Tiles project using Qt Creator.
   \li Edit \c {main.cpp} and replace the \c {#include <QtGui>} instance with
       \c {#include <QtWidgets>}.
       The Perl-script \c fixqt4headers.pl can be used to scan the source files
       of a project and perform the replacements.
   \li Edit the \c {animatedtiles.pro} and add \c {QT += widgets} towards the
       end of the file.
       \note \l{Qt GUI} is included by default in all Qt applications unless excluded using the \c {QT -= gui} directive in the \c{qmake} project file.
   \li Save the changes and run the application.
\endlist

Once you see the application running, check whether it behaves as expected.

It is also possible to keep the project compiling with Qt 4 and Qt 5. This requires:

\list 1
   \li Omitting the module name from all includes by running the
       \c fixqt4headers.pl script with the \c --strip-modules option.
   \li Adding scopes depending on the version of Qt to the \c{.pro} files:
       \code
       greaterThan(QT_MAJOR_VERSION, 4): QT += widgets
       \endcode
   \li Introducing \c #if scopes around code using modified API:
       \code
       #if QT_VERSION >= 0x050000
           headerView->setSectionResizeMode(QHeaderView::ResizeToContents);
       #else
           headerView->setResizeMode(QHeaderView::ResizeToContents);
       #endif
       \endcode
\endlist

\l{Porting from Qt WebKit to Qt WebEngine}{Qt WebKit to Qt WebEngine} porting
instructions.
