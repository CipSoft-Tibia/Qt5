    \title Developing on Raspberry Pi

    With \l {Qt Edu for Developers} package, you can also develop for embedded
    devices with Raspberry Pi as target hardware. This is done by adding a
    \e {Qt Board Support Package} (QBSP) to your existing Qt installation, and
    flashing an SD card used by Raspberry Pi with a \e {Boot to Qt} system
    image.

    \note Windows and Linux are supported as development hosts, but \macos is
          not supported.

    First, complete the \l {Qt Edu for Developers} installation steps before
    continuing.

    \section1 1. Download QBSP

    Log in to your \l {https://login.qt.io/login}{Qt Account}. Go to the
    \uicontrol Downloads section and select \e {Qt for Device Creation QBSP
    for the EDU license} from the drop-down menu in the \uicontrol {Product}
    field.

    Download the correct version of the \e {.qbsp} file for your development
    host (Windows or Linux).

    \section1 2. Run the maintenance tool

    Go to Qt's installation folder, and run \uicontrol {MaintenanceTool}.

    Maintenance tool allows you to modify your existing Qt installation.
    Navigate to \uicontrol {Custom installation} and select
    \uicontrol {Next}.

    Select \uicontrol {Browse QBSP files}. In the file dialog window, locate
    and select the \c {.qbsp} file you downloaded from your Qt Account.

    After this, the list of available components is updated. Under
    \uicontrol {Boot to Qt Software Stack}, select \uicontrol {Raspberry Pi}
    and then \uicontrol {Next}. This will install the Boot to Qt system image
    and toolchain for Raspberry Pi.

    \section1 3. Open Qt Creator

    To complete the setup, the Boot to Qt system image needs to be flashed to
    an SD card used as the boot drive for Raspberry Pi. In addition, Qt Creator
    needs to be configured for connecting to the device running the Boot to Qt
    software stack, using either a wired or wireless network connection.

    These steps are performed in Qt Creator, see
    \l {Qt Creator: Connecting Boot2Qt Devices} for details.
