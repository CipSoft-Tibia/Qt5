    \title Qt Edu for Developers

//! [intro]
    \e {Qt Edu for Developers} gives you access to developing with Qtâ€™s full
    C++ and QML frameworks, as well as its Python bindings. Developing on
    embedded systems is possible with Raspberry Pi as the target platform.
    This package also includes \l {Qt Design Studio Manual}{Qt Design Studio}
    for designing user interfaces.
//! [intro]

    These instructions walk you through the installation of the Qt Edu for
    Developers package.

    \include qt-edu-steps.qdocinc {qt-edu-common-steps} {Qt}

    \image qt-edu-install-qt.png

    If you are new to Qt, we recommend selecting the latest available version
    of \uicontrol {Qt for desktop development}. This installs everything you
    need for developing desktop applications with Qt. The installation may
    always be modified later with the \e {maintenance tool}, located in Qt's
    installation folder.

    Select \uicontrol {Next}.

    \include qt-edu-steps.qdocinc qt-edu-license-agreement

    \section1 9. Finish the installation

    Select \uicontrol {Install} to start the installation process.

    Once installation is complete, you'll see the following screen:

    \image qt-edu-install-finish-qt.png

    Select \uicontrol {Finish} to exit the installer.

    \section1 10. Open Qt Creator

    By default, \e {Qt Creator} opens automatically after closing the installer.
