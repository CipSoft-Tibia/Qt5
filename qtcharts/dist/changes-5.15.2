 - [QTBUG-75500] Prevent zoom-out beyond infinite linear max double values
   When zooming out domains that include log axes, prevent zoom-out when
   the new zoom level would result in a max value that is above the upper
   range of double (represented as inf). Additionally, prevent zoom-out
   when the log value exceeds the number of pixels in the log axis
   dimension. Major gridlines are created at each integral log value, and
   it does not make sense to zoom out beyond such point.
   The bug was: Stack overflow on high zoom out of QChart with a
   logarithmic axis
