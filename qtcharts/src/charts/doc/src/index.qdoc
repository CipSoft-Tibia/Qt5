    \title Qt Charts
    \page qtcharts-index.html

    Qt Charts module provides a set of easy to use chart components. It uses the Qt Graphics View
    Framework, therefore charts can be easily integrated to modern user interfaces. Qt Charts can
    be used as QWidgets, QGraphicsWidget, or QML types. Users can easily create impressive
    graphs by selecting one of the charts themes.

    \section1 Getting Started

    To import Qt Charts QML types, add the following import statement to your \c .qml file:

    \snippet doc_src_qmlcharts.cpp 0

    If you intend to use Qt Charts C++ classes in your application, use the
    following include and using directives:

    \snippet doc_src_qtcharts.cpp 0

    \if !defined(qtforpython)
    \note Projects created with Qt Creator's Qt Quick Application
    wizard are based on the Qt Quick 2 template that uses QGuiApplication by default.
    All such QGuiApplication instances in the project must be replaced with
    QApplication as the module depends on Qt's \l{Graphics View Framework}
    for rendering.

    To link against the Qt Charts module, add this line to your \c qmake project file:

    \snippet doc_src_qtcharts.pro 0
    \endif
