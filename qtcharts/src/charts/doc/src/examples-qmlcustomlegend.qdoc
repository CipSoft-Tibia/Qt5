    \ingroup qtcharts_examples

    \brief This example shows you how to create your own custom legend.

    This application shows you how to create your own custom legend instead of using the
    built-in legend of ChartView API.

    The main view of the application shows a stacked area chart. This is how one of
    the stacked areas is created. See ChartViewStacked.qml and AnimatedAreaSeries.qml.

    Hovering with mouse on top of the legend will highlight the hovered series.
    (see CustomLegend.qml).

    You can also select one of the stacked areas for a closer look as a line series by
    a mouse click (see ChartViewHighlighted.qml).
