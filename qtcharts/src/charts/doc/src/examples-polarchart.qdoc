    \title Polar Chart Example
    \ingroup qtcharts_examples

    \brief The example shows how to create a simple polar chart with multiple different series.

    It also shows how to implement scrolling and zooming of the polar chart as well as
    visually demonstrate how polar charts and cartesian charts relate to each other.

    \section1 Creating Polar Charts

    Creating a polar chart is done with a QPolarChart instance instead of a QChart instance.

    \snippet polarchart/main.cpp 1

    Axes are created similarly to cartesian charts, but when axes are added to the chart,
    you can use polar orientations instead of alignments.

    \snippet polarchart/main.cpp 2

    Zooming and scrolling of a polar chart is logically nearly identical to zooming and scrolling of a cartesian chart.
    The main difference is that when scrolling along the X-axis (angular axis), the angle is used instead of the number of pixels.
    Another difference is that zooming to a rectangle cannot be done.

    \snippet polarchart/chartview.cpp 1

    The same axes and series can be used in both cartesian and polar charts, though not simultaneously.
    To switch between chart types, you first need to remove the series and axes from the old chart, and then add
    them to the new chart. If you want to preserve the axis ranges, those need to be copied, too.
