    \brief C++ classes for the Qt Charts API.

    Charts API is built on top of Qt Graphics View Framework. Charts can be displayed as QGraphicsWidget using the QChart class. However
    there is also the convenience class QChartView, which is QWidget based. These enable us to quickly use Qt Charts as a normal Qt widget.

    If you intend to use Qt Charts C++ classes in your application, use the
    following include and using directives:

    \snippet doc_src_qtcharts.cpp 0

    \if !defined(qtforpython)
    \note Projects created with Qt Creator's Qt Quick Application
    wizard are based on the Qt Quick 2 template that uses QGuiApplication by default.
    All such QGuiApplication instances in the project must be replaced with
    QApplication as the module depends on Qt's \l{Graphics View Framework}
    for rendering.

    To link against the Qt Charts module, add this line to your \c qmake project file:

    \snippet doc_src_qtcharts.pro 0
    \endif

    Each chart type is represented by the QAbstractSeries derived class. To create charts, the users have to use an instance of the related
    series class and add it to a QChart instance.

    \title Qt Charts QML Types
    \ingroup qmlmodules

    \brief QML types for the Qt Charts API.

    The Qt Charts QML API is an intuitive and simple way to show charts in your QML
    applications.

    Use the following QML to create a simple pie chart:
    \image examples_qmlpiechart.png
    \snippet qmlpiechart/qml/qmlpiechart/main.qml 1
    \snippet qmlpiechart/qml/qmlpiechart/main.qml 2
    \snippet qmlpiechart/qml/qmlpiechart/main.qml 3

    \note Since Qt Creator 3.0 the project created with Qt Quick Application wizard based on
    Qt Quick 2 template uses QGuiApplication by default. As Qt Charts utilizes Qt Graphics View
    Framework for drawing, QApplication must be used. The project created with the wizard is
    usable with Qt Charts after the QGuiApplication is replaced with QApplication.
