    \brief This application demonstrates how to use XmlListModel as a datasource for a Chart.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Using List Models as Data Sources

    Let's define an empty ChartView first:
    \snippet qmlf1legends/qml/qmlf1legends/main.qml 1

    Our XmlListModel uses hard-coded test data. In a real application the data source would be a
    timing system.
    \snippet qmlf1legends/qml/qmlf1legends/SpeedsXml.qml 1
    \dots
    \snippet qmlf1legends/qml/qmlf1legends/SpeedsXml.qml 2
    \snippet qmlf1legends/qml/qmlf1legends/main.qml 2

    The data is parsed with a timer. The line series representing each driver are created on the
    fly.
