    \class QAxBindable
    \brief The QAxBindable class provides an interface between a
    QWidget and an ActiveX client.

    \inmodule QAxServer

    The functions provided by this class allow an ActiveX control to
    communicate property changes to a client application. Inherit
    your control class from both QWidget (directly or indirectly) and
    this class to get access to this class's functions. The
    \l{moc}{meta-object compiler} requires you to inherit from
    QWidget first.

    \snippet src_activeqt_control_qaxbindable.cpp 0

    When implementing the property write function, use
    requestPropertyChange() to get permission from the ActiveX client
    application to change this property. When the property changes,
    call propertyChanged() to notify the ActiveX client application
    about the change. If a fatal error occurs in the control, use the
    static reportError() function to notify the client.

    Use the interface returned by clientSite() to call the ActiveX
    client. To implement additional COM interfaces in your ActiveX
    control, reimplement createAggregate() to return a new object of a
    QAxAggregated subclass.

    The ActiveQt \l{activeqt/opengl}{OpenGL} example shows how to use
    QAxBindable to implement additional COM interfaces.

    If the COM object supports a MIME type then this function is called
    to initialize the COM object from the data \a source in \a format.
    You have to open \a source for reading before you can read from it.

    Returns true to indicate success. If the function returns false,
    then ActiveQt will process the data by setting the properties
    through the meta object system.

    If you reimplement this function you also have to implement
    writeData().  The default implementation does nothing and returns
    false.

    \warning ActiveX controls embedded in HTML can use either the
    \c type and \c data attribute of the \c object tag to read data,
    or use a list of \c param tags to initialize properties. If
    \c param tags are used, then Internet Explorer will ignore the
    \c data attribute, and readData will not be called.
