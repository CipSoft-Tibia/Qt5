    \title Active Qt
    \brief Provides ActiveX and COM integration on Windows

    Qt's ActiveX and COM support allows Qt for Windows developers to:

    \list
    \li Access and use ActiveX controls and COM objects provided by any
    ActiveX server in their Qt applications.
    \li Make their Qt applications available as COM servers, with
    any number of Qt objects and widgets as COM objects and ActiveX
    controls.
    \endlist

    For more information about using ActiveX with Qt, see
    \l{Building ActiveX servers in Qt}.

    The ActiveQt framework consists of two modules:

    \list
    \li The \l{Using ActiveX controls and COM in Qt}{QAxContainer}
       module is a static library implementing QObject and QWidget subclasses,
       QAxObject and QAxWidget, that act as containers for COM objects and
       ActiveX controls.
    \li The \l{Building ActiveX servers in Qt}{QAxServer}
       module is a static library that implements
       functionality for in-process and executable COM servers. This
       module provides the QAxAggregated, QAxBindable and QAxFactory
       classes.
    \endlist

    A set of \l{Tools for ActiveQt}{tools} is provided to simplify the
    developing and building of Qt projects that use ActiveX.

    To build the static libraries, change into the \c activeqt directory
    (usually \c QTDIR/src/activeqt), and run \c qmake and your make
    tool in both the \c container and the \c control subdirectory.
    The \c qaxcontainer and \c qaxserver libraries will be linked
    into \c QTDIR/lib.

    If you are using a shared configuration of Qt enter the \c plugin
    subdirectory and run \c qmake and your make tool to build a
    plugin that integrates the QAxContainer module into \l{Qt
    Designer}.
