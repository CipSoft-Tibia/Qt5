    \brief Provides ActiveX and COM integration on Windows

    Qt's ActiveX and COM support enables Qt for Windows developers to:

    \list
      \li Access and use ActiveX controls and COM objects provided by any
      ActiveX server in their Qt applications.
      \li Make their Qt applications available as COM servers, with
      any number of Qt objects and widgets as COM objects and ActiveX
      controls.
    \endlist

    For more information about using ActiveX with Qt, see
    \l{Building ActiveX servers in Qt}.

    The ActiveQt framework consists of two modules:

    \list
      \li The \l{Using ActiveX controls and COM in Qt}{QAxContainer}
        module is a static library that implements a QObject subclass,
        QAxObject, and a QWidget subclass, QAxWidget, which act as containers
        for COM objects and ActiveX controls.
      \li The \l{Building ActiveX servers in Qt}{QAxServer}
        module is a static library that implements functionality for in-process
        and executable COM servers. This module provides the QAxAggregated,
        QAxBindable, and QAxFactory classes.
    \endlist

    A set of \l{Tools for ActiveQt}{tools} is provided to simplify the
    developing and building of Qt projects that use ActiveX.
