    \brief The Media Player example uses the Microsoft Media Player
    ActiveX control to implement a functional media player application.

    \e {Media Player} demonstrates how a Qt application can communicate with
    embedded ActiveX controls using signals, slots, and the \c dynamicCall()
    function.

    \quotefromfile activeqt/mediaplayer/main.cpp
    \skipto class MainWindow
    \printuntil /^\}/

    The \c MainWindow class declares a \c QMainWindow based user interface,
    using the \c Ui::MainWindow class created by Qt Designer. A number
    of slots are implemented to handle events from user interface elements,
    including the \c mediaPlayer object, which is a QAxWidget hosting
    the Microsoft Media Player ActiveX control.

    \quotefromfile activeqt/mediaplayer/main.cpp
    \skipto MainWindow::MainWindow()
    \printuntil /^\}/

    The constructor initializes the user interface, restores a previously
    saved window geometry, and uses the \c dynamicCall() function to invoke
    the APIs implemented by the Microsoft Media Player ActiveX control,
    to set initial configuration parameters.

    \quotefromfile activeqt/mediaplayer/main.cpp
    \skipto MainWindow::on_mediaPlayer_PlayStateChange
    \printuntil /^\}/

    The \c on_mediaPlayer_PlayStateChange slot handles the signal emitted
    by the \c mediaPlayer object when its state changes.

    \quotefromfile activeqt/mediaplayer/main.cpp
    \skipto MainWindow::openMedia
    \printuntil /^\}/

    The \c openMedia() function allows a media file to be opened by using
    the \c dynamicCall() function to set the URL property in the ActiveX
    control, which causes the media file to be loaded and played.

    \quotefromfile activeqt/mediaplayer/main.cpp
    \skipto int main
    \printuntil /^\}/

    The \c main() function starts the application using standard Qt APIs
    and uses an optional command line argument as the name of a media
    file to be loaded by the player.

    To build the example, you must first build the QAxContainer
    library. Then run your make tool in
    \c examples/activeqt/mediaplayer and run the resulting
    \c mediaplayer.exe.
