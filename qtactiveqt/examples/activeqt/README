Qt is supplied with a number of example applications and demonstrations that
have been written to provide developers with examples of the Qt API in use,
highlight good programming practice, and showcase features found in each of
Qt's core technologies.

Documentation for examples can be found via the Examples and Tutorials link
in the main Qt documentation. The examples and their documentation can also
be opened from the Examples tab of Qt Creator's Welcome mode.
