     orthogonal preemption - inner or states interrupt one-another 
conflict between transition originating in state c, and transitions originating in e1 and f1, as transition from c interrupt the others
transitions in e1 and f1 will win, as they are deeper in the hierarchy (even though they come later in document order
initial configuration: [c,e1,f1]
given event t: [c,e2,f2]
