    \title Qt SCXML
    \brief Provides functionality to create state machines from SCXML files.

    The Qt SCXML module provides functionality to create state machines from
    \l {SCXML Specification}{SCXML} files. This includes both dynamically
    creating state machines (loading the SCXML file and instantiating states
    and transitions) and generating a C++ file that has a class implementing
    the state machine. It also contains functionality to support data models
    and executable content.

    \section1 Getting Started

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following directive:

    \code
    #include <QScxmlStateMachine>
    \endcode

    To import the QML types into your application, use the following import statement
    in your .qml file:

    \code
    import QtScxml 5.8
    \endcode

    To link against the module, add this line to your qmake .pro file:

    \code
    QT += scxml
    \endcode
