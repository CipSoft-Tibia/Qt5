    \title Qt SCXML Media Player Example (Dynamic)
    \ingroup examples-qtscxml

    \brief A widget-based application that sends data to and receives it from a
    dynamically loaded ECMAScript data model.

    \image mediaplayer.png

    \e {Media Player Example (Dynamic)} demonstrates how to access data from a
    dynamically loaded ECMAScript data model.

    The UI is created using Qt Widgets.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \include mediaplayer-ecmascript-data-model.qdocinc

    \section1 Dynamically Loading the State Machine

    We link against the Qt SCXML module by adding the following line to the
    example \e .pro file:

    \quotefromfile mediaplayer-widgets-dynamic/mediaplayer-widgets-dynamic.pro
    \skipto QT
    \printuntil scxml

    \quotefromfile mediaplayer-widgets-dynamic/mediaplayer-widgets-dynamic.cpp

    We dynamically create and instantiate the state machine in
    \e mediaplayer-wigdets-dynamic/mediaplayer-widgets-dynamic.cpp:

    \skipto mainwindow.h
    \printuntil /^\}/

    \include mediaplayer-widgets-connecting-to-states.qdocinc
