    \title Qt SCXML Traffic Light Example (Static)
    \ingroup examples-qtscxml

    \brief A widget-based application that uses a compiled state machine to
    implement a traffic light.

    \image trafficlight.png

    \e{Traffic Light Example (Static)} demonstrates how to connect to the
    active properties of a state in a state machine that is compiled to a class.

    The UI is created using Qt Widgets.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \include trafficlight-compiling.qdocinc

    \section1 Instantiating the State Machine

    We instantiate the generated \c TrafficLightStateMachine class in the
    \e trafficlight-widgets-static.cpp file, as follows:

    \quotefromfile trafficlight-widgets-static/trafficlight-widgets-static.cpp
    \skipto #include
    \printuntil }

    \include trafficlight-state-machine.qdocinc

    We connect to the states as follows:

    \quotefromfile trafficlight-common/trafficlight.cpp
    \skipto connectToState
    \printuntil greenLight
