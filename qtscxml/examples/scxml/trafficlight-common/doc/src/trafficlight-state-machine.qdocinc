    \section1 Connecting to States

    In the SCXML file, we specify states for each light: red, yellow, and green.
    In the \c <onentry> element, we specify the event to send when entering
    the state and the delay in seconds before sending the event. In the
    \c <transition> element, we specify the event that triggers the transition
    to the state specified by the \c target attribute:

    \quotefromfile trafficlight-common/statemachine.scxml
    \skipto <state id="red">
    \printuntil <state id="green">
    \printuntil </state>
