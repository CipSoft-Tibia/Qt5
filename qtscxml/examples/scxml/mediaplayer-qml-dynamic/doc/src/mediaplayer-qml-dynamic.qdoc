    \title Qt SCXML Media Player QML Example (Dynamic)
    \ingroup examples-qtscxml

    \brief A Qt Quick application that sends data to and receives it from a
    dynamically loaded ECMAScript data model.

    \image mediaplayer.png

    \e {Media Player QML Example (Dynamic)} demonstrates how to access data from
    a dynamically loaded ECMAScript data model.

    The UI is created using Qt Quick.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \include mediaplayer-ecmascript-data-model.qdocinc

    \section1 Dynamically Loading the State Machine

    We link against the Qt SCXML module by adding the following line to the
    example \e .pro file:

    \quotefromfile mediaplayer-qml-dynamic/mediaplayer-qml-dynamic.pro
    \skipto QT
    \printline scxml

    We dynamically create the state machine in
    \e mediaplayer-common\Mediaplayer.qml:

    \quotefromfile mediaplayer-common/Mediaplayer.qml
    \skipto import QtScxml
    \printuntil scxmlLoader.source
