    \title Qt SCXML  Traffic Light QML Example (Static)
    \ingroup examples-qtscxml

    \brief A Qt Quick application that uses a compiled state machine to
    implement a traffic light.

    \image trafficlight.png

    \e{Traffic Light QML Example (Static)} demonstrates how to connect to the
    active properties of a state in a state machine that is compiled to a class.

    The UI is created using Qt Quick.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \include trafficlight-compiling.qdocinc

    \section1 Instantiating the State Machine

    We instantiate the state machine as follows:

    \quotefromfile trafficlight-qml-static/trafficlight-qml-static.qml

    \skipto TrafficLight
    \printuntil }

    \include trafficlight-state-machine.qdocinc

    We connect to the states as follows:

    \quotefromfile trafficlight-common/Lights.ui.qml
    \skipto states
    \printuntil ]
