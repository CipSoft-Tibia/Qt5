    \title Qt SCXML Calculator Example

    \brief A widget-based application that implements the Calculator example
    presented in the SCXML Specification.

    \e {Calculator} uses Qt SCXML to implement the
    \l{SCXML Specification - Calculator Example}{Calculator Example}
    presented in the SCXML Specification.

    The state machine is specified in the \e statemachine.scxml file and
    compiled into the \c CalculatorStateMachine class. The user interface is
    created using Qt Widgets.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \include calculator-compiling.qdocinc

    \section1 Instantiating the State Machine

    We instantiate the generated \c CalculatorStateMachine class in the
    \e calculator-widgets.cpp file, as follows:

    \quotefromfile calculator-widgets/calculator-widgets.cpp
    \skipto #include
    \printuntil }

    \section1 Connecting to Active Properties

    After instantiating the state machine, we can connect to the active
    properties of the states, as follows:

    \quotefromfile calculator-widgets/mainwindow.cpp
    \skipto connect
    \printuntil digit2
    \printuntil }

    The state machine can notify other code when events occur:

    \quotefromfile calculator-common/statemachine.scxml
    \skipto transition event="DISPLAY.UPDATE
    \printuntil </transition

    We connect to the \c updateDisplay event to display the data passed by
    the events:

    \quotefromfile calculator-widgets/mainwindow.cpp
    \skipto connectToEvent
    \printuntil });
