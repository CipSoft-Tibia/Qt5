    \section1 Connecting to States

    The media player state machine will send out events when users tap a control
    and when playback starts or stops, as specified in the SCXML file:

    \quotefromfile mediaplayer-common/mediaplayer.scxml
    \skipto <state
    \printuntil !==
    \printuntil </state

    To be notified when a state machine sends out an event, we connect to the
    corresponding signals:

    \quotefromfile mediaplayer-common/mainwindow.cpp
    \skipto connectToEvent
    \printuntil playbackStopped
