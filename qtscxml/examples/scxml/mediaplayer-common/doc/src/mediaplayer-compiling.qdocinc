    \section1 Compiling the State Machine

    We link against the Qt SCXML module by adding the following line to the
    \e .pro file:

    \quotefromfile mediaplayer-widgets-static/mediaplayer-widgets-static.pro
    \skipto QT
    \printline scxml

    We then specify the state machine to compile:

    \skipto STATECHARTS
    \printline scxml

    The Qt SCXML Compiler, \c qscxmlc, is run automatically to generate
    \e statemachine.h and \e statemachine.cpp, and to add them to the \c HEADERS
    and \c SOURCES variables for compilation.
