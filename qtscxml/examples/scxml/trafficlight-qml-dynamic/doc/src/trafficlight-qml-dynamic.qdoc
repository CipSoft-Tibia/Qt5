    \title Qt SCXML Traffic Light QML Example (Dynamic)
    \ingroup examples-qtscxml

    \brief A Qt Quick application that uses a dynamically loaded state machine
    to implement a traffic light.

    \image trafficlight.png

    \e{Traffic Light QML Example (Dynamic)} demonstrates how to connect to the
    active properties of a state in a dynamically loaded state machine.

    The UI is created using Qt Quick.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Dynamically Loading the State Machine

    We link against the Qt SCXML module by adding the following line to the
    example \e .pro file:

    \quotefromfile trafficlight-qml-dynamic/trafficlight-qml-dynamic.pro
    \skipto QT
    \printline scxml

    We dynamically create the state machine in the main QML file:

    \quotefromfile trafficlight-qml-dynamic/trafficlight-qml-dynamic.qml
    \skipto import QtScxml
    \printuntil /^\}/

    \include trafficlight-state-machine.qdocinc

    We connect to the states as follows:

    \quotefromfile trafficlight-common/Lights.ui.qml
    \skipto states
    \printuntil ]
