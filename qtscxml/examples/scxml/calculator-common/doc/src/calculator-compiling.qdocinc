    \section1 Compiling the State Machine

    We link against the Qt SCXML module by adding the following line to the
    \e .pro file:

    \quotefromfile calculator-widgets/calculator-widgets.pro
    \printuntil scxml

    We then specify the state machine to compile:

    \skipto STATECHARTS
    \printuntil statemachine.scxml

    The Qt SCXML Compiler, \c qscxmlc, is run automatically to generate
    \e statemachine.h and \e statemachine.cpp, and to add them to the \c HEADERS
    and \c SOURCES variables for compilation.
