    \ingroup technology-apis
    \qtvariable winextras

    The QtWin namespace contains Windows-specific functions for type
    conversions and DWM glass frame manipulation.

    The classes enable you to use features introduced with Windows 7, such as
    Jump Lists, a progress indicator on a taskbar button, or a thumbnail
    toolbar.
