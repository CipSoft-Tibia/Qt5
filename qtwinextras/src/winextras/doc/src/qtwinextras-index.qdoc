    \title Qt Windows Extras
    \brief Provides classes and functions for using some Windows APIs in a Qt way

    Qt Windows Extras provide classes and functions that enable you to use
    miscellaneous Windows-specific functions. For example, you can convert Qt
    objects to Windows object handles and manipulate DWM glass frames.

    In addition, you can use features introduced with Windows 7, such as Aero
    Peek, Jump Lists, a progress indicator on a taskbar button, or a thumbnail
    toolbar.
