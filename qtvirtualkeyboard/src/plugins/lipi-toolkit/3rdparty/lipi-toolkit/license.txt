Lipi core toolkit is licensed under the MIT license.

- MIT-Style License
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php

This is the weakest license, meaning it applies the least restrictions. It is used for 
most parts of the Lipi Toolkit, and especially for libraries which are potentially 
included (by copying) into other libraries (as sub-components). The intention is to make 
sure the covered software can be used really everywhere and for every reason without any 
real restrictions.
