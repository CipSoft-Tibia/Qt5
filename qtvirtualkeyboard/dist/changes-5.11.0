****************************************************************************

 -  Added support for displaying gestures in word suggestions
   in T9 Write handwriting input mode.
 -  Fixed an issue in the T9 Write input mode that caused the
   current word suggestion to be rejected when a character was entered
   through the keyboard.
 -  Added support for the new UCR (Unconstrained Character
   Recognition) mode introduced in T9 Write v8.0.0 handwriting input.
   In the UCR mode it is possible to write the entire word with one
   stroke. The UCR mode is enabled by default in English, French,
   Italian, German, Spanish and Arabic languages.
 -  Optimize UI performance by eliminating the need to wait
   for previous results to be completed during T9 Write handwriting.
 -  Add option to use external language dialog instead of
   built-in language popup.
 - [QTBUG-67510] Fix full screen edit mode with word candidate list always
   visible.
