  \title Qt Purchasing
  \brief A cross-platform library to facilitate in-app purchases in Qt and Qt Quick application

  Qt Purchasing is an add-on library that enables Qt applications to support
  in-app purchases. It is a cross-platform library that currently supports
  purchases made to the Mac App Store on OS X, App Store on iOS, and Google Play on Android.

  \section1 In-App Purchases

  In-app purchases are a way to monetize an application. These purchases are
  made from inside the application and can include anything from unlocking
  content to virtual items. The Qt Purchasing API is built on the system APIs
  for in-app purchases, which means the purchase process is more familiar to
  the user, and the information already stored by the platform (such as credit
  card information) can be used to simplify the purchase process.

  \section1 Getting Started

  Qt Purchasing provides C++ classes and QML types to access information about
  in-app products registered in the external store on the current platform, as
  well as to request purchases for those products.

  \section2 The Store

  The in-app products must be registered in the target stores, before they
  can be queried or purchased in an application. We recommend using the same
  identifiers for the products in each store, as it simplifies the code to
  query and purchase the products.

  \li \l{Registering Products in App Store}
  \li \l{Registering Products in Windows Store}
  \endlist

  \section2 Writing the Code

  Depending on what fits best with the application, you can choose to use either C++ or
  QML to support in-app purchasing. If most of the user interface is written in QML,
  we recommend that you use the QML types, which provide a simple and declarative
  point of access for the products in the store.

  \endlist

  \section1 Examples

  Take a look at the \l{Qt Purchasing Examples} for a demonstration on
  how the APIs can be used in applications.

  \section1 Licenses and Attributions

  Qt Purchasing is available under commercial licenses from \l{The Qt Company}.
  In addition, it is available under the \l{GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3}.
  See \l{Qt Licensing} for further details.
