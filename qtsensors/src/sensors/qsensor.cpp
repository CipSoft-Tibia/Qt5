    \brief The qoutputrange class holds the specifics of an output range.
    \since 5.1

    The class is defined as a simple struct.

    \code
    struct qoutputrange
    {
        qreal maximum;
        qreal minimum;
        qreal accuracy;
    };
    \endcode

    Each output range specifies a minimum and maximum value as well as an accuracy value.
    The accuracy value represents the resolution of the sensor. It is the smallest change
    the sensor can detect and is expressed using the same units as the minimum and maximum.

    Sensors must often trade off range for accuracy. To allow the user to determine which of
    these are more important the sensor may offer several output ranges. One output
    range may have reduced minimum and maximum values and increased sensitivity. Another output
    range may have higher minimum and maximum values with reduced sensitivity. Note that higher
    sensitivities will be represented by smaller accuracy values.

    An example of this tradeoff can be seen by examining the LIS302DL accelerometer. It has only
    256 possible values to report with. These values are scaled so that they can represent either
    -2G to +2G (with an accuracy value of 0.015G) or -8G to +8G (with an accuracy value of 0.06G).

    \brief The QSensor class represents a single hardware sensor.

    The life cycle of a sensor is typically:

    \list
    \li Create a sub-class of QSensor on the stack or heap.
    \li Setup as required by the application.
    \li Start receiving values.
    \li Sensor data is used by the application.
    \li Stop receiving values.
    \endlist

    The sensor data is delivered via QSensorReading and its sub-classes.

    \section1 Orientation

    Some sensors react to screen orientation changes, such as QAccelerometer, QMagnetometer and
    QRotationSensor. These are so called \e orientable sensors. For orientable sensors,
    QSensor supports changing the reporting of the reading values based on the orientation of the
    screen.

    For orientable sensors, the axesOrientationMode property controls how the orientation affects
    the reading values.

    In the default mode, QSensor::FixedOrientation, the reading values remain
    unaffected by the orientation. In the QSensor::AutomaticOrientation mode, the reading
    values are automatically rotated by taking the current screen orientation into account. And
    finally, in the QSensor::UserOrientation mode, the reading values are rotated
    according to a user-specified orientation.

    The functionality of this is only available if it is supported by the backend and if the sensor
    is orientable, which can be checked by calling QSensor::isFeatureSupported()
    with the QSensor::AxesOrientation flag.

    The orientation values here are always of the screen orientation, not the device orientation.
    The screen orientation is the orientation of the GUI. For example when rotating a device by 90
    degrees counter-clockwise, the screen orientation compensates for that by rotating 90 degrees
    clockwise, to the effect that the GUI is still facing upright after the device has been rotated.
    Note that applications can lock the screen orientation, for example to force portrait or landscape
    mode. For locked orientations, orientable sensors will not react with reading changes if the device
    orientation is changed, as orientable sensors react to screen orientation changes only. This makes
    sense, as the purpose of orientable sensors is to keep the sensor orientation in sync with the screen
    orientation.

    The orientation values range from 0 to 270 degrees. The orientation is applied in clockwise direction,
    e.g. an orientation value of 90 degrees means that the screen has been rotated 90 degress to the right
    from its origin position, to compensate a device rotation of 90 degrees to the left.

    \enum QSensor::Feature
    \brief Lists optional features a backend might support.

    The features common to all sensor types are:

    \value Buffering The backend supports buffering of readings, controlled by the
                     QSensor::bufferSize property.
    \value AlwaysOn The backend supports changing the policy on whether to suspend when idle,
                    controlled by the QSensor::alwaysOn property.
    \value SkipDuplicates The backend supports skipping of same or very similar successive
                          readings. This can be enabled by setting the QSensor::skipDuplicates
                          property to true.

    The features of QMagnetometer are:

    \value GeoValues The backend supports returning geo values, which can be
                     controlled with the QMagnetometer::returnGeoValues property.

    The features of QLightSensor are:

    \value FieldOfView The backend specifies its field of view, which can be
                       read from the QLightSensor::fieldOfView property.

    The features of QAccelerometer are:

    \value AccelerationMode The backend supports switching the acceleration mode
                            of the acceleromter with the QAccelerometer::accelerationMode property.

    The features of QPressureSensor are:

    \value PressureSensorTemperature The backend provides the pressure sensor's die temperature

    The features of all orientable sensors are:

    \value AxesOrientation The backend supports changing the axes orientation from the default of
                           QSensor::FixedOrientation to something else.

    Duplicate skipping is not just enabled for readings that are exactly the same, but also for

/*!
    \property QSensor::axesOrientationMode
    \since 5.1
    \brief The mode that affects how the screen orientation changes reading values.

    When set to FixedOrientation, which is the default mode, no automatic rotation is applied to
    the reading. This is the only mode available for backends that do not support the
    QSensor::AxesOrientation feature.

    When set to AutomaticOrientation, the reading values are automatically rotated when the
    screen orientation changes. In effect, the screen orientation is canceled out.

    As an example, assume the device is rotated by 180 degrees and therefore the screen orientation
    also is rotated by 180 degrees from the native orientation. Without automatic axes orientation,
    the reading values would now be changed: Both the X and the Y values would be negated, forcing
    an application developer to manually cancel out the negation in application code. Automatic
    axes orientation does this automatically, in this mode the X and Y values would be the same as
    with the default screen orientation.

    This automatic rotation of the axes is handy is some usecases, for example in a bubble level
    application that measures how level a surface is by looking at the X axis value of an
    accelerometer. When the device and screen orientation change by 90 degrees, an application
    developer does not need to change anything, he can continue using the X axis value even though
    the device is rotated. Without automatic axes orientation, the application developer would need
    to look at the Y values instead, thereby adding code to the application that reads from a
    different axis depending on the screen orientation.

    The UserOrientation mode is quite similar to AutomaticOrientation, only that the screen orientation
    is manually controlled instead of automatically determined. The angle of the userOrientation
    property is then used for rotating the reading values.

    Since the rotation of the reading values is based on the screen orientation, Z values will never
    change, as the Z axis is perpendicular to the screen.
    As screen orientation changes in 90 degree steps, rotating the reading values is also done in
    steps of 90 degrees.

    This property is only used for orientable sensors.

/*!
    \property QSensor::bufferSize

    This property holds the size of the buffer. By default, the buffer size is 1,
    which means no buffering.
    If the maximum buffer size is 1, then buffering is not supported
    by the sensor.

    Setting bufferSize greater than maxBufferSize will cause maxBufferSize to be used.

    Buffering is turned on when bufferSize is greater than 1. The sensor will collect
    the requested number of samples and deliver them all to the application at one time.
    They will be delivered to the application as a burst of changed readings so it is
    particularly important that the application processes each reading immediately or
    saves the values somewhere else.

    If stop() is called when buffering is on-going, the partial buffer is not delivered.

    When the sensor is started with buffering option, values are collected from that
    moment onwards. There is no pre-existing buffer that can be utilized.

    Some backends only support enabling or disabling the buffer and do not give
    control over the size. In this case, the maxBufferSize and efficientBufferSize properties
    might not be set at all, even though buffering is supported. Setting the bufferSize property
    to any value greater than 1 will enable buffering. After the sensor has been started,
    the bufferSize property will be set to the actual value by the backend.
