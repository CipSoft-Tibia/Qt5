\title QtSensorGestures Emulator
\brief Explains how to develop clients and recognizer plugins using QtSensorGestures

\section1 Overview

The Emulator can be used for both creating client apps using Qt's built-in sensor gestures,
and for creating customized recognizers.

\section1 Developing Sensor Gesture Clients

For instance, the Emulator can be used for writing a client app that needs
to use the "slam" gesture.

Under the "Sensors" heading in the Emulator control, you will see an edit
box for "Sensor gestures" that will contain a list of signals available
when your client instantiates a QSensorGesture.

Select "slam", and then click the "Send" button
to send a detected("slam") signal to the client.
