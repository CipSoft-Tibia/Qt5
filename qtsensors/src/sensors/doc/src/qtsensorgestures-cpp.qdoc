\title Sensor Gestures C++ Overview
\brief Explains how to use the QtSensorGestures C++ API

\tableofcontents

\section1 Using QtSensorGestures

With the Sensor Gestures classes, you are able to easily utilize device gesturing using
sensors, such as the accelerometer and proximity.

A list of currently supported sensor gestures and their descriptions can be found here:
\l  {Qt Sensor Gestures}

Using \c QtSensorGestures is easy. There are two main classes you will need to use:

\list
   \li QSensorGestureManager: can be used for determining which sensor gestures are available.
   \li QSensorGesture : for connecting the sensor gesture signals.
\endlist

\snippet sensorgestures/creating.cpp Receiving sensor gesture signals

More information about the sensor gesture recognizers can be found in
\l{QtSensorGestures Plugins}.
