    \since 5.1

    \brief The QRotationReading class represents one reading from the
           rotation sensor.

    \section2 QRotationReading Units

    The rotation reading contains 3 angles, measured in degrees that define
    the orientation of the device in three-dimensional space. These angles
    are similar to yaw, pitch and roll but are defined using only right hand
    rotation with axes as defined by the right hand cartesian coordinate system.

    \image sensors-rotation.jpg

    The three angles are applied to the device in the following order.

    \list
    \li Right-handed rotation z (-180, 180]. Starting from the y-axis and
     incrementing in the counter-clockwise direction.
    \li Right-handed rotation x [-90, 90]. Starting from the new
     (once-rotated) y-axis and incrementing towards the z-axis.
    \li Right-handed rotation y (-180, 180]. Starting from the new
     (twice-rotated) z-axis and incrementing towards the x-axis.
    \endlist

    Here is a visualization showing the order in which angles are applied.

    \image sensors-rotation-anim.gif

    The 0 point for the z angle is defined as a fixed, external entity and
    is device-specific. While magnetic North is typically used as this
    reference point it may not be. Do not attempt to compare values
    for the z angle between devices or even on the same device if it has
    moved a significant distance.

    If the device cannot detect a fixed, external entity the z angle will
    always be 0 and the QRotationSensor::hasZ property will be set to false.

    The 0 point for the x and y angles are defined as when the x and y axes
    of the device are oriented towards the horizon. Here is an example of
    how the x value will change with device movement.

    Here is an example of how the y value will change with device movement.

    \image sensors-rotation3.jpg

    Note that when x is 90 or -90, values for z and y achieve rotation around
    the same axis (due to the order of operations). In this case the y
    rotation will be 0.
