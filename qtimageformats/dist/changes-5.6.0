- For security reasons, MNG and JPEG 2000 handlers will no longer be
  built by default, unless the required codec library is found on the
  system. I.e., the bundled 3rd party libraries will by default not be
  used. In practice, this means that the qmng and qjp2 handlers will
  not be present by default.

  The reason is that upstream development of those codes libraries has
  stalled, so security issues are not addressed.

  Users who still want these handlers using the bundled libraries can
  easily build them from the source projects:
  src/plugins/imageformats/jp2/jp2.pro
  src/plugins/imageformats/mng/mng.pro
