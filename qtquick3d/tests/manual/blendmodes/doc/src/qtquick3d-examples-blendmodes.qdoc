    \title Qt Quick 3D - Blend Modes Example
    \brief Demonstrates the use of different blend modes.
    \image blendmodes-example.png

    This example demonstrates a number of blend modes that can be used in a Qt Quick 3D application.
    Blending is done between two \l {View3D}s using \l {QtGraphicalEffects}.

    \section1 Creating Views

    We create two views. The first view is the background view, and may have a
    non-transparent \l {SceneEnvironment::backgroundMode}{background mode} and
    \l {SceneEnvironment::clearColor}{clear color} set.

    \snippet blendmodes/BackgroundView.qml background

    The second view is the foreground view, and it must have transparent
    \l {SceneEnvironment::backgroundMode}{background mode}.

    \snippet blendmodes/ForegroundView.qml foreground

    \section1 Blending

    As the blending is done with \l {QtGraphicalEffects}, we need to import it into our
    \c {main.qml}.

    \snippet blendmodes/main.qml extra import

    The foreground view is blended on top of the background view using the
    \l {QtGraphicalEffects::Blend}{Blend} type.
