\title Exporting from Blender
\page quick3d-asset-conditioning-export-blender

It is possible to export meshes, lights, cameras, transform animations (scale/rotation/location),
UV layouts, pivot points, object hierarchy, and material slots from Blender.

\section1 Exporting Models

\section2 Create Material Slots

Material slots must be created and assigned in Blender before exporting. If this is not done,
one default material slot is used for the object.

\note Only material slots that have a material, and that are assigned to a mesh on the exported
object, will be imported.

To create material slots, follow the steps below.

\list 1
  \li In the properties panel, select the \uicontrol material tab.
  \li Press the \uicontrol + to add a new material slot.
  \li Press the \uicontrol{New} button.
  \image export-blender1.png
  \li Repeat steps 2 to 4 for each material slot to create.
\endlist

By default, the first material slot will be assigned to the object.

To assign a different material slot to the object, or to assign several material slots to the
same object, follow the steps below.

\list 1
  \li In edit mode, select the desired faces.
  (\e{Shift + Right Mouse Click} to multi select, \e{A} to select all faces).
  \li In the properties panel, select the material tab.
  \li In the material slots list, select the desired material slot.
  \li Press the \uicontrol{Assign} button to assign the selected material slot to selected faces.

\endlist

\section2 UV Unwrap Models

UV unwrapping your model will create a UV layout. Without a UV layout you will not be able to
render any textures on your model in Qt Quick 3D.

There are many different ways and techniques to unwrap 3D meshes. The most basic way to do it in
Blender is described below.

\list 1
  \li In edit mode, press \e A to select the whole mesh.
  \li Press the \e U key and select \uicontrol{Unwrap} from the context menu.

\endlist

\section2 Triangulate

\list 1
  \li In object mode, select the object.
  \li In the properties panel, select the modifiers tab.
  \li In the drop down list, select \uicontrol{Triangulate}.
  \image export-blender4.png
  \li Press \uicontrol{Apply}.
\endlist

\note When exporting as COLLADA, it is possible to do the triangulation in the actual export step.

\section2 Bake Actions for Animations

\note This step is necessary only if you are exporting animations that are using custom curves
or object constraints to control the animation.

Actions are data-blocks containing animation data. If you are exporting animations you need to
bake actions.

\list 1
  \li Press the \e{space bar} key.
  \li Type \e{bake actions}.
  \li Press the \e Enter key.
\endlist

\section2 Apply Location, Rotation, and Scale

\note This should not be done when exporting animations.

Applying transform values resets the object's location, rotation, and scale values. Location and
rotation values are changed to 0 while scale values are changed to 1. The object itself does not
visually change.

\list 1
  \li In object mode, select the object.
  \li Press the \e{Ctrl + A} keys.
  \li Select \uicontrol {Location}.
  \li From the check box in the panel, check also \uicontrol Rotation and \uicontrol {Scale}.
  \image export-blender5.png
\endlist

\note Applying Location will also reset the object's origin (pivot point).

\section1 Exporting Lights

You can export lights of any type from Blender to use in Qt Quick 3D.

The following properties are imported:
\list
  \li Position, rotation, scale
  \li Brightness
  \li Light color
  \li Cast shadows
\endlist

Light type is imported (and converted if needed).

\table
  \header
    \li
      Light type in Blender
    \li
      Will import to Qt Quick 3D as...
  \row
    \li
      Point
    \li
      Point
  \row
    \li
      Area
    \li
      Area
  \row
    \li
      Sun
    \li
      Directional
  \row
    \li
      Spot
    \li
      Directional
  \row
    \li
      Hemi
    \li
      Directional
\endtable

\section1 Exporting Cameras

You can export perspective and orthographic cameras from Blender to use in Qt Quick 3D.

The following properties are imported:
\list
  \li Position, rotation, scale
  \li Clipping start/end
  \li Focal Length (perspective camera only).
\endlist

\section1 Exporting COLLADA from Blender

\list 1
  \li From the file menu, select \uicontrol {File > Export > Collada (.dae)}.
  \li Ensure that \uicontrol Triangulation is checked on, unless you already have
  triangulated all meshes.
  \li Select the \uicontrol {Export COLLADA} button.
\endlist

\section1 Exporting FBX from Blender

In order to export as FBX, you must have the FBX export add-on installed and enabled
in Blender. With the default installation of Blender, the \c {Import-Export: FBX format} should be
installed. If you do not have the option to export as FBX avaialble, ensure that the add-on is
enabled by following the steps:

\list 1
  \li
  Select \uicontrol {File > User Preferences}.
  \li
  Select \uicontrol{Add-ons} from the top menu bar.
  \li
  Search for \e{fbx}.
  \li
  The add-on should now be visible, enable it by selecting the checkbox next to its name.
\endlist

\image export-blender-enable-fbx-addon.png

Next, to export as FBX, follow these steps:

\list 1
  \li Select \uicontrol {File > Export > FBX (.fbx)}.
  \li Under the \uicontrol Main tab, set \uicontrol Forward to \c{Y Forward} and \uicontrol Up
  to \c{Z Up}.
  \image export-blender-fbx-axis.png
  \li For animations, ensure that the \uicontrol{Baked Animation} option is checked in the
  \uicontrol Animation tab.

  \li Select the \uicontrol {Export FBX} button.
\endlist
