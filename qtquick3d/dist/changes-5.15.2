 - [QDS-2637] Do not sync renderer until the View3D component is complete
   In QDS, the first update is triggered by blank object creation (looks
   like this happens inside Qt, so we can't easily change that), and
   things like dynamic properties are set afterwards. This led to custom
   material and effect objects being incomplete at the time
   updateSpatialNode was called. Fixed by waiting for component
   completion in View3D before synchorizing renderer.
   The bug was: Shader compilation fails if custom material shaders
   require any shader uniform properties
 - [QDS-2636] Rename shaderInfo to shaderInformation in CustomMaterial template
   'shaderInfo' as id causes issues in QDS, as it conflicts with with
   propertyName it's assigned to.
   The bug was: Custom effects and materials do not work correctly in
   editor unless defined in components
 - [QDS-2637] Fix issue of generating uniforms for custom materials and effects
   When custom material or effect was defined in the currently open qml
   document in QDS, the uniforms could not be properly parsed, because
   QDS wraps all dynamic properties in QVariant type. Fixed by digging
   for the actual type from the value.
   The bug was: Shader compilation fails if custom material shaders
   require any shader uniform properties
 - [QDS-2609] Fix a UV generation bug without a shader key
   The bug was: Imported 3D model appearing completely black
