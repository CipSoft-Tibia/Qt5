  \qmltype Scatter3D

  \since QtDataVisualization 1.0
  \ingroup datavisualization_qml
  \brief 3D scatter graph.

  This type enables developers to render scatter graphs in 3D with Qt Quick 2.

  You will need to import data visualization module to use this type:

  \snippet doc_src_qmldatavisualization.cpp 0

  After that you can use Scatter3D in your qml files:

  \snippet doc_src_qmldatavisualization.cpp 2

  See \l{Qt Quick 2 Scatter Example} for more thorough usage example.

/*!
  \qmlproperty ValueAxis3D Scatter3D::axisX
  The active x-axis.

  If an axis is not given, a temporary default axis with no labels and an
  automatically adjusting range is created.
  This temporary axis is destroyed if another axis is explicitly set to the same
  orientation.
 */

/*!
  \qmlproperty ValueAxis3D Scatter3D::axisY
  The active y-axis.

  If an axis is not given, a temporary default axis with no labels and an
  automatically adjusting range is created.
  This temporary axis is destroyed if another axis is explicitly set to the same
  orientation.
 */

/*!
  \qmlproperty ValueAxis3D Scatter3D::axisZ
  The active z-axis.

  If an axis is not given, a temporary default axis with no labels and an
  automatically adjusting range is created.
  This temporary axis is destroyed if another axis is explicitly set to the same
  orientation.

/*!
 * \qmlproperty Scatter3DSeries Scatter3D::selectedSeries
 * The selected series or null.
 */

/*!
 * \qmlproperty list<Scatter3DSeries> Scatter3D::seriesList
 * \default
 * This property holds the series of the graph.
 * By default, this property contains an empty list.
 * To set the series, either use the addSeries() method or define them as
 * children of the graph.
 */

/*!
 * \qmlmethod void Scatter3D::addSeries(Scatter3DSeries series)
 * Adds the \a series to the graph. A graph can contain multiple series, but has only one set of
 * axes. If the newly added series has specified a selected item, it will be highlighted and
 * any existing selection will be cleared. Only one added series can have an active selection.
 */

/*!
 * \qmlmethod void Scatter3D::removeSeries(Scatter3DSeries series)
 * Remove the \a series from the graph.
