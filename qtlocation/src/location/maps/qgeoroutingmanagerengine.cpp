    \since 5.6

    \brief The QGeoRoutingManagerEngine class provides an interface and
    convenience methods to implementers of QGeoServiceProvider plugins who want
    to provide access to geographic routing information.

    \note There are no source or binary compatibility guarantees for the
    backend classes. The API is only guaranteed to work with the Qt version it
    was developed against. API changes will however only be made in minor
    releases. (6.6, 6.7, and so on.)

    Subclasses of QGeoRoutingManagerEngine need to provide an implementation of
    calculateRoute().

    In the default implementation, supportsRouteUpdates() returns false and
    updateRoute() returns a QGeoRouteReply object containing a
    QGeoRouteReply::UnsupportedOptionError.

    If the routing service supports updating routes as they are being
    traveled, the subclass should provide an implementation of updateRoute()
    and call setSupportsRouteUpdates(true) at some point in time before
    updateRoute() is called.

    The function setSupportsRouteUpdates() is one of several functions which
    configure the reported capabilities of the engine.  If the capabilities
    of an engine differ from the default values these functions should be
    used so that the reported capabilities are accurate.

    It is important that this is done before calculateRoute(), updateRoute()
    or any of the capability reporting functions are used to prevent
    incorrect or inconsistent behavior.

    A subclass of QGeoRouteManagerEngine will often make use of a subclass
    fo QGeoRouteReply internally, in order to add any engine-specific
    data (such as a QNetworkReply object for network-based services) to the
    QGeoRouteReply instances used by the engine.
