    \class QGeoRouteReply
    \inmodule QtLocation
    \ingroup QtLocation-routing
    \since 5.6

    \brief The QGeoRouteReply class manages an operation started by an instance
    of QGeoRoutingManager.

    Instances of QGeoRouteReply manage the state and results of these
    operations.

    The isFinished(), error() and errorString() methods provide information
    on whether the operation has completed and if it completed successfully.

    The finished() and error(QGeoRouteReply::Error,QString)
    signals can be used to monitor the progress of the operation.

    It is possible that a newly created QGeoRouteReply may be in a finished
    state, most commonly because an error has occurred. Since such an instance
    will never emit the finished() or
    error(QGeoRouteReply::Error,QString) signals, it is
    important to check the result of isFinished() before making the connections
    to the signals. The documentation for QGeoRoutingManager demonstrates how
    this might be carried out.

    If the operation completes successfully the results will be able to be
    accessed with routes().
*/

/*!
    \enum QGeoRouteReply::Error

    Describes an error which prevented the completion of the operation.

    \value NoError
        No error has occurred.
    \value EngineNotSetError
        The routing manager that was used did not have a QGeoRoutingManagerEngine instance associated with it.
    \value CommunicationError
        An error occurred while communicating with the service provider.
    \value ParseError
        The response from the service provider was in an unrecognizable format.
    \value UnsupportedOptionError
        The requested operation or one of the options for the operation are not
        supported by the service provider.
    \value UnknownError
        An error occurred which does not fit into any of the other categories.
