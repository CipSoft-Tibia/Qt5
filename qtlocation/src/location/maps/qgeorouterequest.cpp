    \class QGeoRouteRequest
    \inmodule QtLocation
    \ingroup QtLocation-routing
    \since 5.6

    \brief The QGeoRouteRequest class represents the parameters and restrictions
    which define a request for routing information.

    The default state of a QGeoRouteRequest instance will result in a request
    for basic route segment and navigation maneuvers describing the fastest
    route by car which covers the given waypoints.

    There may be significant variation in the features supported by different
    providers of routing information, or even in the features supported by
    the same provider if different levels of authorization are used.

    There are several functions in QGeoRoutingManager which can be used to
    check which features are supported with the current provider and
    authorization level.
    \sa QGeoRoutingManager

/*
    DESIGN NOTE

    There are plans to make this extensible by allowing the user to set a
    list of QGeoTransportOptions (or QGeoTransitOptions).  We don't have any
    subclasses for that just yet, otherwise they'd be present.

    A QGeoPublicTransportOption subclass would allow users to specify things
    like cost limits, the maximum number of changes of vehicle, the maximum
    walking time / distance between changes of vehicle.

    There's Nokia / Navteq support for specifying things like Truck attributes
    so you can route around various road restrictions and conditions which
    effect trucks.

    A QGeoTrafficAwareTransportOption is probably also a good place to put the
    inputs for the various traffic / time aware bits of information. A
    departure / arrrival time could be set, and the presence of this transport
    options subclass (and the fact that user auth said that the user had
    support) would mean we could provide better values for the estimated
    travel times and so on.

    This all relies on at least one service making this data available to us,
    which would probably be tied to token based authorization.  It could be
    some time before this becomes available.
