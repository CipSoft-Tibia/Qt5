    \since 5.6

    \brief The QGeoCodingManagerEngine class provides an interface and
    convenience methods to implementers of QGeoServiceProvider plugins who want
    to provide support for geocoding operations.

    In the default implementation, supportsGeocoding() and supportsReverseGeocoding() returns false while
    geocode() and reverseGeocode()
    cause QGeoCodeReply::UnsupportedOptionError to occur.

    If the service provider supports geocoding the subclass should provide an
    implementation of geocode() and call setSupportsGeocoding(true) at
    some point in time before geocode() is called.

    Similarly, if the service provider supports reverse geocoding the subclass
    should provide an implementation reverseGeocode() and call
    setSupportsReverseGeocoding(true) at some point in time before
    reverseGeocode() is called.

    A subclass of QGeoCodingManagerEngine will often make use of a subclass
    fo QGeoCodeReply internally, in order to add any engine-specific
    data (such as a QNetworkReply object for network-based services) to the
    QGeoCodeReply instances used by the engine.

    Begins the geocoding of \a address. Geocoding is the process of finding a
    coordinate that corresponds to a given address.

    A QGeoCodeReply object will be returned, which can be used to manage the
    geocoding operation and to return the results of the operation.

    This engine and the returned QGeoCodeReply object will emit signals
    indicating if the operation completes or if errors occur.

    If supportsGeocoding() returns false an
    QGeoCodeReply::UnsupportedOptionError will occur.

    Once the operation has completed, QGeoCodeReply::locations() can be used to
    retrieve the results, which will consist of a list of QGeoLocation objects.
    These objects represent a combination of coordinate and address data.

    The address data returned in the results may be different from \a address.
    This will usually occur if the geocoding service backend uses a different
    canonical form of addresses or if \a address was only partially filled out.

    If \a bounds is non-null and a valid QGeoShape it will be used to
    limit the results to those that are contained by \a bounds. This is
    particularly useful if \a address is only partially filled out, as the
    service will attempt to geocode all matches for the specified data.

    The user is responsible for deleting the returned reply object, although
    this can be done in the slot connected to QGeoCodingManagerEngine::finished(),
    QGeoCodingManagerEngine::error(), QGeoCodeReply::finished() or
    QGeoCodeReply::error() with deleteLater().

    represent a combination of coordinate and address data.

    The coordinate data returned in the results may be different from \a
    coordinate. This will usually occur if the reverse geocoding service
    backend shifts the coordinates to be closer to the matching addresses, or
    if the backend returns results at multiple levels of detail.

    If multiple results are returned by the reverse geocoding service backend
    they will be provided in order of specificity. This normally occurs if the
    backend is configured to reverse geocode across multiple levels of detail.
    As an example, some services will return address and coordinate pairs for
    the street address, the city, the state and the country.

    limit the results to those that are contained by \a bounds.
