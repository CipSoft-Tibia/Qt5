    \since QtLocation 5.5

    \brief The RouteSegment type represents a segment of a Route.

    A RouteSegment instance has information about the physical layout
    of the route segment, the length of the route and estimated time required
    to traverse the route segment and optional RouteManeuvers associated with
    the end of the route segment.

    RouteSegment instances can be thought of as edges on a routing
    graph, with RouteManeuver instances as optional labels attached to the
    vertices of the graph.

    The primary means of acquiring Route objects is via Routes via \l RouteModel.

    \section1 Example

    The following QML snippet demonstrates how to print information about a
    route segment:

    \snippet declarative/routing.qml QtQuick import
    \snippet declarative/maps.qml QtLocation import
    \codeline
    \snippet declarative/routing.qml RouteSegment

    To access individual segments you can use standard list accessors: 'path.length'
    indicates the number of objects and 'path[index starting from zero]' gives
    the actual object.
