    The Places API is currently designed for only saving \a {core} details.  Saving rich content like
    images and reviews or details like supplier and rating is not a supported use case.  Typically a manager
    will generally ignore these fields upon save and may produce a warning message if they are populated.

    The Places API only supports saving of the following \e {core details}:
    \list
        \li name
        \li place id
        \li location
        \li contact details
        \li icon
        \li categories (tag-like names to describe a place)
        \li visibility scope
    \endlist

    It is possible that providers may only support a subset of these.
    See the \l {Qt Location#Plugin References and Parameters}{plugin documentation} for more
    details.

    Saving of properties such as the rating, extended attributes,
    images, reviews, editorials and supplier is explicitly not supported by the Places API.
