A place is a point of interest, it could be a favorite restaurant, a park or someone's home.
A QPlace object represents a place by acting as a container for various information about that place.

This information can be divided into 2 broad classifications

\list
\li Details
\li Rich content
\endlist

The place details consist of properties of the place, such as the name,
location, contact information and so on. When a place is returned during a
search, these details are filled in. Sometimes in order to save bandwidth,
there are further details about the place that can be retrieved on an
individual place by place basis, if the user is interested. The
QPlace::detailsFetched() function can be queried to see if all available
details have been fetched, and if not, QPlaceManager::getPlaceDetails() can
be used to retrieve them. Precisely which details are populated during a
search and which need to be fetched individually may vary from provider to
provider.  See \l {Qt Location#Plugin References and Parameters}{plugin documentation} for
more details.

The rich content of a place consists of items such as images, reviews and
editorials.  Potentially there may be many rich content items, so they are
treated separately from the place details. They can be retrieved in a paged
fashion via QPlaceManager::getPlaceContent(). If necessary, the content may
be assigned to a place so it can act as a convenient container.
