    \since 5.2

    \brief The Address QML type represents a specific location as a street address.

    An Address is used as a unit of data for queries such as (Reverse) Geocoding
    or Places searches -- many of these operations either accept an Address
    or return one.

    Not all properties of an Address are necessarily available or relevant
    in all parts of the world and all locales. The \l district, \l state and
    \l county properties are particularly area-specific for many data sources,
    and often only one or two of these are available or useful.

    The Address has a \l text property which holds a formatted string.  It
    is the recommended way to display an address to the user and typically
    takes the format of an address as found on an envelope, but this is not always
    the case.  The \l text may be automatically generated from constituent
    address properties such as \l street, \l city and and so on, but can also
    be explicitly assigned.  See \l text for details.

    \section2 Example Usage

    The following code snippet shows the declaration of an Address object.

    \code
    Address {
        id: address
        street: "53 Brandl St"
        city: "Eight Mile Plains"
        country: "Australia"
        countryCode: "AUS"
    }
    \endcode

    This could then be used, for example, as the value of a geocoding query,
    to get an exact longitude and latitude for the address.

    \qmlproperty string QtPositioning::Address::text

    This property holds the address as a single formatted string. It is the recommended
    string to use to display the address to the user. It typically takes the format of
    an address as found on an envelope, but this is not always necessarily the case.

    The address \c text is either automatically generated or explicitly assigned,
    this can be determined by checking \l isTextGenerated.

    If an empty string is assigned to \c text, then \l isTextGenerated will be set
    to true and \c text will return a string which is locally formatted according to
    \l countryCode and based on the properties of the address. Modifying the address
    properties such as \l street, \l city and so on may cause the contents of \c text to
    change.

    If a non-empty string is assigned to \c text, then \l isTextGenerated will be
    set to false and \c text will always return the explicitly assigned string.
    Modifying address properties will not affect the \c text property.
