    \ingroup qtpositioning-examples

    \brief The GeoFlickr example shows how to use the user's current position to
           fetch local content from a web service.

    This is a small example, illustrating one of the very core parts of the
    \l{Qt Positioning} API: the ability to retrieve and use the user's current
    geographic position.

    Key QML types shown in this example:
    \list
        \li \l{QtPositioning::PositionSource}{PositionSource}
        \li \l{XmlListModel}{XmlListModel}
    \endlist

    \section1 Retrieving the Current Position

    Retrieving the user's current position is achieved using the PositionSource
    type. In this example, we instantiate the PositionSource as part of the
    GeoTab component (the floating "window" describing current position and
    status).

    When the "Locate and update" button is pressed, we first interrogate the
    PositionSource to check if it has an available backend for positioning
    data. If it does not, we fall back to using a pre-recorded NMEA log
    for demonstration. We then instruct the PositionSource to update.

    To share the new position data with the rest of the application, we use
    properties that we have created on the GeoTab component:

    \section1 Using the Current Position

    The longitude and latitude values retrieved here are eventually set on
    in properties on the RestModel component. The RestModel is an XmlListModel,
    which retrieves XML data from a URL and creates a data model by performing
    XPath queries on it.

    In this case, it retrieves data from the Flickr REST API online, based on
    our current position

    This model data is then shown in a variety of Qt Quick views to produce
    the example application.
