    \class QWebSocket

    \inmodule QtWebSockets
    \since 5.3
    \brief Implements a TCP socket that talks the WebSocket protocol.

    WebSockets is a web technology providing full-duplex communications channels over
    a single TCP connection.
    The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as
    \l {RFC 6455} in 2011.
    QWebSocket can both be used in a client application and server application.

    This class was modeled after QAbstractSocket.

    QWebSocket currently does not support \l {WebSocket Extensions}.

    QWebSocket only supports version 13 of the WebSocket protocol, as outlined in
    \l {RFC 6455}.

    \note Some proxies do not understand certain HTTP headers used during a WebSocket handshake.
    In that case, non-secure WebSocket connections fail. The best way to mitigate against
    this problem is to use WebSocket over a secure connection.

    \warning To generate masks, this implementation of WebSockets uses the reasonably
    secure QRandomGenerator::global()->generate() function.
    For more information about the importance of good masking,
    see \l {"Talking to Yourself for Fun and Profit" by Lin-Shung Huang et al}.
    The best measure against attacks mentioned in the document above,
    is to use QWebSocket over a secure connection (\e wss://).
    In general, always be careful to not have 3rd party script access to
    a QWebSocket in your application.

    \title QWebSocket client example
    \brief A sample WebSocket client that sends a message and displays the message that
    it receives back.

    \section1 Description
    The EchoClient example implements a WebSocket client that sends a message to a WebSocket server
    and dumps the answer that it gets back.
    This example should ideally be used with the EchoServer example.
    \section1 Code
    We start by connecting to the `connected()` signal.
    \snippet echoclient/echoclient.cpp constructor
    After the connection, we open the socket to the given \a url.

    \snippet echoclient/echoclient.cpp onConnected
    When the client is connected successfully, we connect to the `onTextMessageReceived()` signal,
    and send out "Hello, world!".
    If connected with the EchoServer, we will receive the same message back.

    \snippet echoclient/echoclient.cpp onTextMessageReceived
    Whenever a message is received, we write it out.

This signal can be emitted when a \a proxy that requires

    This signal is emitted when the server requires authentication.

    to allow authentication and continue the connection.

    If you know that the server may require authentication, you can set the
    username and password on the initial QUrl, using QUrl::setUserName and
    QUrl::setPassword. QWebSocket will still try to connect \e{once} without
    using the provided credentials.

    \note QAbstractSocket::ConnectedState is emitted after the handshake
    with the server has succeeded.

    QAbstractSocket::SocketState is not a registered metatype, so for queued

    This signal is emitted every time a payload of data has been written to the socket.
    The \a bytes argument is set to the number of bytes that were written in this payload.

    \note This signal has the same meaning both for secure and non-secure WebSockets.

/*!
    \fn void QWebSocket::sslErrors(const QList<QSslError> &errors)
    QWebSocket emits this signal after the SSL handshake to indicate that one or more errors have
    occurred while establishing the identity of the peer.
    The errors are usually an indication that QWebSocket is unable to securely identify the peer.
    Unless any action is taken, the connection will be dropped after this signal has been emitted.
    If you want to continue connecting despite the errors that have occurred, you must call
    QWebSocket::ignoreSslErrors() from inside a slot connected to this signal.
    If you need to access the error list at a later point, you can call sslErrors()
    (without arguments).

    \a errors contains one or more errors that prevent QWebSocket from verifying the identity of
    the peer.

    \note You cannot use Qt::QueuedConnection when connecting to this signal, or calling
    QWebSocket::ignoreSslErrors() will have no effect.
*/
/*!
    \fn void QWebSocket::preSharedKeyAuthenticationRequired(QSslPreSharedKeyAuthenticator *authenticator)
    \since 5.8

    This signal is emitted if the SSL/TLS handshake negotiates a PSK
    ciphersuite, and therefore a PSK authentication is then required.

    When using PSK, the client must send to the server a valid identity and a
    valid pre shared key, in order for the SSL handshake to continue.
    Applications can provide this information in a slot connected to this
    signal, by filling in the passed \a authenticator object according to their
    needs.

    \note Ignoring this signal, or failing to provide the required credentials,
    will cause the handshake to fail, and therefore the connection to be aborted.

    \note The \a authenticator object is owned by the websocket and must not be
    deleted by the application.

    QWebSocket can emit this signal several times during the SSL handshake,
    before encryption has been established, to indicate that an error has
    occurred while establishing the identity of the peer. The \a error is
    usually an indication that QWebSocket is unable to securely identify the
    peer.

    This signal provides you with an early indication when something's wrong.
    By connecting to this signal, you can manually choose to tear down the
    connection from inside the connected slot before the handshake has
    completed. If no action is taken, QWebSocket will proceed to emitting
    QWebSocket::sslErrors().

    QWebSocket emits this signal if an alert message was sent to a peer. \a level
    describes if it was a warning or a fatal error. \a type gives the code
    of the alert message. When a textual description of the alert message is
    available, it is supplied in \a description.

    \note This signal is mostly informational and can be used for debugging
    purposes, normally it does not require any actions from the application.

    QWebSocket emits this signal if an alert message was received from a peer.
    \a level tells if the alert was fatal or it was a warning. \a type is the
    code explaining why the alert was sent. When a textual description of
    the alert message is available, it is supplied in \a description.

    \note The signal is mostly for informational and debugging purposes and does not
    require any handling in the application. If the alert was fatal, underlying

    QWebSocket emits this signal if a certificate verification error was
    found and if early error reporting was enabled in QSslConfiguration.
    An application is expected to inspect the \a error and decide if
    it wants to continue the handshake, or abort it and send an alert message
    to the peer. The signal-slot connection must be direct.
