    \title Qt WebSockets
    \brief Provides an implementation of the WebSocket protocol.

    WebSocket is a web-based protocol designed to enable two-way communication
    between a client application and a remote host. It enables the two entities
    to send data back and forth if the initial handshake succeeds. WebSocket is
    the solution for applications that struggle to get real-time data feeds
    with less network latency and minimum data exchange.

    The Qt WebSockets module provides C++ and QML interfaces that enable
    Qt applications to act as a server that can process WebSocket requests,
    or a client that can consume data received from the server, or both.

    \section1 Getting Started

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following directive:

    \code
    #include <QtWebSockets/QtWebSockets>
    \endcode

    To  import the QML types into your application, use the following import statement in your .qml file:

    \qml \QtMinorVersion
    import QtWebSockets 1.\1
    \endqml

    To link against the module, add this line to your qmake .pro file:

    \code
    QT += websockets
    \endcode

    \section1 Licenses

    Qt WebSockets is available under commercial licenses from \l{The Qt Company}.
    In addition, it is available under free software licenses. Since Qt 5.4,
    these free software licenses are
    \l{GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3}, or

    \title Testing Qt WebSockets

    \l {Autobahn|Testsuite}, a standard test
    suite for WebSocket Protocol (\l{RFC 6455}), can be used for testing the
    conformance of Qt WebSockets. Refer to
    \l {Autobahn|Testsuite installation documentation}
    to set up the test suite.
