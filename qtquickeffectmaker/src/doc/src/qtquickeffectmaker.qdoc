    \title \QQEM

    \QQEM is a tool for creating shader effects for
    Qt Quick with high productivity and performance. You can run \QQEM
    as a standalone tool but it is also included in
    \l{https://doc.qt.io/qtdesignstudio/}{Qt Design Studio}.

    \section1 Feature overview

    The main features of \QQEM:

    \list
      \li \b {Live preview}: When you work with effects, you can see most changes instantly in the
      live preview.
      \li \b {Node view}: In the node view, you build effects without coding. There are
      over 30 nodes, including most of the Qt Graphical Effects.
      \li \b {Code view}: In the code view, you can edit the code of all effect node shaders. The
      code editor features include GLSL syntax highlighting, auto indent, search, and more.
      \li \b {Combined effects}: For increased performance, \QQEM combines all the
      effects in one shader.
      \li \b {JSON file format}: \QQEM stores project and node files in JSON format,
      making it easy to share files for increased productivity.
      \li \b {Shadertoy compatibility}: Variable naming in \QQEM is in most cases
      compatible with \l{http://www.shadertoy.com}{Shadertoy}, making it easy to port Shadertoy
      shaders to \QQEM and the other way around. Most Shadertoy features and some
      extra features, such as vertex shaders, custom textures, and properties, are supported.
      \li \b {Pure Qt Quick}: \QQEM is implemented with Qt Quick and
      Qt Quick Controls. The work flow is designed for Qt Quick and Qt RHI.
