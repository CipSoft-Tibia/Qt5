XQuery queries and XPath expressions can be used in Qt with the
Qt XML Patterns module.

XQuery is a query language used to query XML in a concise and safe manner.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples and Tutorials
link in the main Qt documentation. The examples and their documentation can
also be opened from the Examples tab of Qt Creator's Welcome mode.
