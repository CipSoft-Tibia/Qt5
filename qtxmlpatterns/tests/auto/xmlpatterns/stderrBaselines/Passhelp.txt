   xmlpatterns -- A tool for running XQuery queries.

  -                          When appearing, any following options are not 
                             interpreted as switches.
  -help                      Displays this help.
  -initial-template <string> The name of the initial template to call as a 
                             Clark Name.
  -is-uri                    If specified, all filenames on the command line 
                             are interpreted as URIs instead of a local
                             filenames.
  -no-format                 By default output is formatted for readability. 
                             When specified, strict serialization is
                             performed.
  -output <local file>       A local file to which the output should be 
                             written. The file is overwritten, or if not
                             exist, created. If absent, stdout is used.
  -param <name=value>        Binds an external variable. The value is 
                             directly available using the variable
                             reference: $name.
  -version                   Displays version information.
  focus <string>             The document to use as focus. Mandatory in case 
                             a stylesheet is used. This option is also
                             affected by the is-uris option.
  query/stylesheet <string>  A local filename pointing to the query to run. 
                             If the name ends with .xsl it's assumed to be
                             an XSL-T stylesheet. If it ends with .xq, it's
                             assumed to be an XQuery query. (In other cases
                             it's also assumed to be an XQuery query, but
                             that interpretation may change in a future
                             release of Qt.)
