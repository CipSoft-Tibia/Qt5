(: Purpose: Check that an attribute value's value is properly read and serialized. Since the whitespace is expressed with character references they are preserved and hence aren't subject to for instance end-of-line handling. Subsequently, the serialization process must escape such characters in order to not have the parser normalize the values when being read back in. :)
