   patent infringement </title>
   <content>
      <par> In surprising developments today, Foobar Corporation
         announced that it is suing Gorilla Corporation for patent
         infringement. The patents that were mentioned as part of the
         lawsuit are considered to be the basis of Foobar
         Corporation's <quote>Wireless Foo</quote> line of products.
      </par>
      <par>The tension between Foobar and Gorilla Corporations has
         been increasing ever since the Gorilla Corporation acquired
         more than 40 engineers who have left Foobar Corporation,
         TheAppCompany Inc. and YouNameItWeIntegrateIt.com over the
         past 3 months. The engineers who have left the Foobar
         corporation and its partners were rumored to be working on
         the next generation of server products and applications which
         will directly compete with Foobar's Foo 20.9 servers. Most of
         the engineers have relocated to Hawaii where the Gorilla
         Corporation's server development is located.
