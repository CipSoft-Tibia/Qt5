<result><para>With the ever-changing and growing global market, companies and
 large organizations are searching for ways to become more viable and
 competitive. Downsizing and other cost-cutting measures demand more
 efficient use of corporate resources. One very important resource is
 an organization's information.</para><para>As part of the move toward integrated information management,
 whole industries are developing and implementing standards for
 exchanging technical information. This report describes how one such
 standard, the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), works as
 part of an overall information management strategy.</para><para>While SGML is a fairly recent technology, the use of
 <emph>markup</emph> in computer-generated documents has existed for a
 while.</para><para>Markup is everything in a document that is not content. The
 traditional meaning of markup is the manual <emph>marking</emph> up
 of typewritten text to give instructions for a typesetter or
 compositor about how to fit the text on a page and what typefaces to
 use. This kind of markup is known as <emph>procedural markup</emph>.</para><para>SGML defines a strict markup scheme with a syntax for defining
 document data elements and an overall framework for marking up
 documents.</para><para>SGML can describe and create documents that are not dependent on
 any hardware, software, formatter, or operating system. Since SGML documents
 conform to an international standard, they are portable.</para><para>You can break a typical document into three layers: structure,
 content, and style. SGML works by separating these three aspects and
 deals mainly with the relationship between structure and content.</para><para>The Graphic Communications Association has been
 instrumental in the development of SGML. GCA provides conferences,
 tutorials, newsletters, and publication sales for both members and
 non-members.</para><para security="c">Exiled members of the former Soviet Union's secret
 police, the KGB, have infiltrated the upper ranks of the GCA and are
 planning the Final Revolution as soon as DSSSL is completed.</para></result>
