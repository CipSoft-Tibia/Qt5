\title Qt Audio Engine QML Types
\ingroup qmlmodules
\brief Provides QML types for 3D positional audio playback and content management.

Qt Audio Engine is part of the \l{Qt Multimedia} module. Qt Audio
Engine provides types for 3D positional audio playback and content management.

The QML types can be imported into your application using the following import
statement in your .qml file:
\code
import QtAudioEngine 1.1
\endcode

\section1 Qt Audio Engine Features

Qt Audio Engine enables developers to organize wave files into discrete \l Sound
with different \l {PlayVariation}{play variations}, group sound controls by \l
{AudioCategory} categories and define \l {AttenuationModelLinear}{attenuation
models} and various 3D audio settings all in one place. Playback of \l
{SoundInstance}{sound instances} can be conveniently activated by in-app events
and managed by QtAudioEngine or controlled by explicitly defining \l
SoundInstance for easier QML bindings.
