    \class QAudioSink
    \brief The QAudioSink class provides an interface for sending audio data to
    an audio output device.

    \inmodule QtMultimedia
    \ingroup multimedia
    \ingroup multimedia_audio

    You can construct an audio output with the system's
    default audio output device. It is also possible to
    create QAudioSink with a specific QAudioDevice. When
    you create the audio output, you should also send in
    the QAudioFormat to be used for the playback (see
    the QAudioFormat class description for details).

    To play a file:

    Starting to play an audio stream is simply a matter of calling
    start() with a QIODevice. QAudioSink will then fetch the data it
    needs from the io device. So playing back an audio file is as
    simple as:

    \snippet multimedia-snippets/audio.cpp Audio output class members

    \snippet multimedia-snippets/audio.cpp Audio output setup

    The file will start playing assuming that the audio system and
    output device support it. If you run out of luck, check what's
    up with the error() function.

    After the file has finished playing, we need to stop the device:

    \snippet multimedia-snippets/audio.cpp Audio output stop

    At any given time, the QAudioSink will be in one of four states:
    active, suspended, stopped, or idle. These states are described
    by the QtAudio::State enum.
    State changes are reported through the stateChanged() signal. You
    can use this signal to, for instance, update the GUI of the
    application; the mundane example here being changing the state of
    a \c { play/pause } button. You request a state change directly
    with suspend(), stop(), reset(), resume(), and start().

    If an error occurs, you can fetch the \l{QtAudio::Error}{error
    type} with the error() function. Please see the QtAudio::Error enum
    for a description of the possible errors that are reported. When
    QtAudio::UnderrunError is encountered, the state changes to QtAudio::IdleState,
    when another error is encountered, the state changes to QtAudio::StoppedState.
    You can check for errors by connecting to the stateChanged()
    signal:

    \snippet multimedia-snippets/audio.cpp Audio output state changed
