Qt 5.0.2 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
source compatibility with Qt 5.0.0 and 5.0.1.

However, to fix a bug we detected after the 5.0 release, this release
has a limited binary compatibility break. We therefore recommend all
users to recompile their applications that provided QtMultimedia
plugins or dealt with them directly. This is an exceptional case:
compatibility will be kept for further releases.

For more details, refer to the online documentation included in this
distribution. The documentation is also available online:
