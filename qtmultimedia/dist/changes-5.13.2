Qt 5.13.2 is a bug-fix release. It maintains both forward and backward
source compatibility with Qt 5.13.0 through 5.13.1.
In Qt 5.13.0, binary compatibility was broken due to the usage of the enum
QVideoSurfaceFormat::PixelFormat, the break has been reverted,
thus introducing a binary compatibility break with earlier Qt 5.13.0 and 5.13.1.

For more details, refer to the online documentation included in this
distribution. The documentation is also available online:

https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/index.html

The Qt version 5.13 series is binary compatible with the 5.12.x series.
Applications compiled for 5.12 will continue to run with 5.13.

*                            Qt 5.13.2 Changes                             *
****************************************************************************

 - In Qt 5.13.0 binary compatibility was broken
   for usage of the enum QVideoSurfaceFormat::PixelFormat by introducing
   QVideoSurfaceFormat::Format_ABGR32.
   To minimize the impact of this, the break has been reverted,
   thus introducing a binary compatibility break with earlier Qt 5.13.x
   versions, but restoring compatibility with all earlier versions of Qt 5.
 - Fixed crash when VideoOutput.sourceRect is requested but playback is stopped.
 - [QTBUG-51588] Fixed leaking of QVideoFilterRunnable when window is closed.
 - [QTBUG-45064] Introduced QGraphicsVideoItem::type().
 - Fixed camera.viewfinder to respect camera's media status
   if the viewfinder is requested after the camera is loaded.

 - GStreamer:
   * CameraBin plugin now fetches supported viewfinder settings at status

   * [QTBUG-78079] Fixed media player to recreate playbin features after custom pipeline.
