TODO list for spectrum analyser
===============================

Bug fixes
---------


New features
------------

* Wrap user-visible strings in tr()

* Allow user to set frequency range
There should be some constraints on this, e.g.
  - Maximum frequency must not be greater than Nyquist frequency
  - Range is divisible by number of bars?

* Add more visualizers other than bar spectrogram
e.g. Funky OpenGL visualizers, particle effects etc


Non-functional stuff
--------------------

* Improve robustness of QComboBox -> enum mapping
At the moment, SettingsDialog relies on casting the combobox item index directly to the enumerated type.  This is clearly a bit fragile...

* For functions which take or return qint64 values, make a clear distinction between duration (microseconds) and length (bytes).
A sensible convention would be that the default is bytes - i.e. microseconds must be indicated by adding a Us suffix, where not already obvious from the function name.
