This utility tests stability of audio configuration on macOS, and prints it.
It reads audio config via AudioObjectGetPropertyData many times, checks if it changes, and dumps results.
It might be useful to check the configuration if specific audio devices are installed on your PC
and Qt multimedia handles them incorrectly or writes warnings to the console.
It's a good idea to attach a text file with the utility's output when creating a bug for audio on macOS.
In order to test an unstable config, set some sufficient testing time and just attach/detach a device.


Build:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make


Run:

./test_audio_config
Running without parameters performs some default testing. Use --help to see customization details.


Lazy build, run, and dump the result to file test_audio_config_res.txt:

./compile_and_run.sh
