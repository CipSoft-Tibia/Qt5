    \title Qt CoAP
    \brief Provides classes and functions to make CoAP programming simple and
    portable.

    Constrained Application Protocol (\l CoAP) is a machine-to-machine (M2M) web
    transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained networks in
    the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed to easily interface with HTTP for
    integration with the Web, while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast
    support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments.

    The Qt CoAP module implements the client side of CoAP defined by \l{RFC 7252}.
    Generally, CoAP is designed to use datagram-oriented transport such as UDP, so
    the current implementation of the transport is based on UDP. However implementing
    custom transports based on TCP, WebSocket, and so on, is also possible.

    The Qt CoAP module supports:

    \list
    \li Security based on Datagram TLS (DTLS) over UDP
    \li Group communication defined by \l{RFC 7390}
    \li Blockwise transfers defined by \l{RFC 7959}
    \li Resource observation defined by \l{RFC 7641}
    \li Resource discovery (multicast and single server)
    \endlist

    \include module-use.qdocinc using qt module

    \code
    find_package(Qt6 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Coap)
    target_link_libraries(mytarget PRIVATE Qt6::Coap)
    \endcode

    See also the \l {Build with CMake} overview.

    \include module-use.qdocinc building with qmake

    \code
