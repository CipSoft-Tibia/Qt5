 - General:
   * It is now possible to explicitly call overloaded methods or connect to
     overloaded signals by specifying the full method or signal signature
     in string form on the JavaScript side.
   * Send current property values when another transport is accessing a
     previously wrapped object.
   * Various improvements in the handling of nested wrapped objects.
   * Async calls to C++ methods from the JavaScript side will now return
     a Promise if no callback is given and the JavaScript runtime supports
     promises.
