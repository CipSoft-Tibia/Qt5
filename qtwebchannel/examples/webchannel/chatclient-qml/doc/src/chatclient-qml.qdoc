    \title Qt WebChannel ChatClient QML Example
    \ingroup qtwebchannel-examples
    \brief A QML client that communicates over a WebSocket with a QWebChannel server.

    \image chatclient-qml.png

    \e{ChatClient QML} provides a simple QWebChannel client implemented using JavaScript and QML.

    \section1 Running the Example

    To run the example, enter the following command in the client source
    directory:

    \c {path/to/qmlscene qmlchatclient.qml}

    \section1 Implementing a Web Channel Client

    The client initializes a \l [QML] WebSocket connection to the chat server and receives an object
    containing all the necessary signals, slots, and properties for implementing a chat client.

    After login, the client can invoke the method \c sendMessage and receive the signal \c newMessage
    to send and receive messages. Furthermore, a \c userList property provides the
    names of all other connected clients. It is automatically updated when its contents change.
    Also, the client responds to the server's keep alive signal which is needed to detect disconnected
    clients and remove them from the \c userList property.

    The example shows how basic elements can be used with the client JavaScript implementation of
    QWebChannel, like connecting to signals (\c newMessage), calling slots (\c sendMessage), and handling
    property changes (\c userList).

    The client is able to work with the \l{Qt WebChannel ChatServer Example}.
