    \title Qt WebChannel
    \brief Bridges the gap between Qt applications and HTML/JavaScript.

    Qt WebChannel enables peer-to-peer communication between a server (QML/C++
    application) and a client (HTML/JavaScript or QML application). It is
    supported out of the box by \l{Qt WebEngine}. In addition it can work on all
    browsers that support \l{Qt WebSockets}{WebSockets}, enabling Qt WebChannel
    clients to run in any JavaScript environment (including QML). This requires
    the implementation of a custom transport based on Qt WebSockets.

    The module provides a JavaScript library for seamless integration of C++
    and QML applications with HTML/JavaScript and QML clients. The clients must use the
    JavaScript library to access the serialized QObjects published by the host
    applications.

    \section1 Getting Started

    To use these classes in your application, use the following include
    statement:

    \code
    #include <QtWebChannel/QtWebChannel>
    \endcode

    To link against the module, add this line to your \l qmake \c .pro file:

    \code
    QT += webchannel
    \endcode

    The QML types are accessed by using:
    \badcode
    import QtWebChannel 1.0
    \endcode
