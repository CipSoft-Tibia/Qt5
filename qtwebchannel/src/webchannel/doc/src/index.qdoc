    \title Qt WebChannel
    \brief Bridges the gap between Qt applications and HTML/JavaScript.

    Qt WebChannel enables peer-to-peer communication between a server (QML/C++
    application) and a client (HTML/JavaScript or QML application). It is
    supported out of the box by \l{Qt WebEngine}. In addition, it can work on
    all browsers that support \l{Qt WebSockets}{WebSockets}, enabling Qt
    WebChannel clients to run in any JavaScript environment (including QML).
    This requires implementing a custom transport based on Qt WebSockets.

    The module provides a JavaScript library for seamless integration of C++ and
    QML applications with HTML/JavaScript and QML clients. The clients must use
    the JavaScript library to access the serialized QObjects published by the
    host applications.
