    \title Adventures with QDoc's line comments
    \brief Test that line comments don't break documentation.

    The purpose of this test data is to provide a regression mechanism as part
    of QDoc's end-to-end test, tst_generatedOutput, for an issue (QTBUG-105754)
    that was reported against QDoc's \\sa command. The issue, as experienced by
    the reporter of the bug, is that if the \\sa command is followed by a line
    comment, QDoc generates a series of "Missing comma in \\sa" warnings.

    \section1 Further details
    The bug report is at \l https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-105754.
