<p>The purpose of this test data is to provide a regression mechanism as part of QDoc's end-to-end test, tst_generatedOutput, for an issue (QTBUG-70959) that was reported against QDoc's \keyword command. The issue, as experienced by the reporter of the bug, is that if the \keyword command isn't followed by a new command, or is the last command in a paragraph, the following paragraph is &quot;eaten&quot;. That means the entire paragraph is understood by QDoc as keywords and included as html meta information instead of as part of the rendered output.</p>
<h2 id="further-details">Further details</h2>
<p>The bug report is at <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-70959" translate="no">https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-70959</a>. It refers to a change that bypassed the issue by moving the \keyword command, at <a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtdoc/+/242033/" translate="no">https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtdoc/+/242033/</a>.</p>
