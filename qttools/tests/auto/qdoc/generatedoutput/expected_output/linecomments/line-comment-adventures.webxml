                <para>The purpose of this test data is to provide a regression mechanism as part of QDoc's end-to-end test, tst_generatedOutput, for an issue (QTBUG-105754) that was reported against QDoc's \sa command. The issue, as experienced by the reporter of the bug, is that if the \sa command is followed by a line comment, QDoc generates a series of &quot;Missing comma in \sa&quot; warnings.</para>
