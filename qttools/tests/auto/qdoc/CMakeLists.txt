# Mirrors the definition for test targets from the source directory to the
# "tests" directory.
# The CI for the Qt project is set up so that, when tests are run in CI, only
# the "tests" directory under the root of a repo is configured and test targets
# are later run over an already built Qt (with everything exported from the
# various src directories).
# This means that any target that is defined outside the "tests" directory in
# the root of the repo will not be picked up for testing by CI.
#
# As QDoc is currently organizing so that its part of the "src" directory
# contains everything related to its of its subprojects, tests included, our
# tests targets will not be checked by CI.
#
# To avoid this issue, each test target is defined in its own self-contained
# "CMakeLists.txt" file under its correct place in the "src" directory and is
# later included here to ensure that it is picked up when Ci run the tests for
# the qttools repository.
#
# Outside of CI, both the "src" and "tests" directory will be configured and we
# need to avoid repeating the targets definition.
#
# When CI is running its tests, it will set `QT_BUILD_STANDALONE_TESTS`, which
# we can depend on to filter the inclusions.
