Qt Designer is a capable graphical user interface designer that lets you
create and configure forms without writing code. GUIs created with
Qt Designer can be compiled into an application or created at run-time.

Some of the examples in this directory can only be used from within Qt
Designer.


Documentation for these examples can be found via the Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.
