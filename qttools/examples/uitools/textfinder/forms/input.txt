This user interface was loaded and processed at run-time.

Applications that want to load .ui files at run-time must be configured to be link against the QtUiTools module. A form loader object, provided by the QUiLoader class, is used to construct the user interface. This user interface can be retrieved from any QIODevice; for example, a QFile object can be used to obtain a form stored in a project's resources. The QUiLoader::load() function takes the user interface description contained in the file and constructs the form widget.
