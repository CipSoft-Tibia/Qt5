    \title Qt UI Tools

    \brief Provides classes to handle forms created with Qt Designer.

    Qt Designer forms are processed at run-time to produce dynamically generated
    user interfaces. In order to generate a form at run-time, a resource
    file containing a UI file is needed.

    A form loader object, provided by the QUiLoader class, is used to construct
    the user interface. This user interface can be retrieved from any QIODevice.
    For example, a QFile object can be used to obtain a form stored in a
    project's resources. The QUiLoader::load() function takes the user interface
    description contained in the file and constructs the form widget.
