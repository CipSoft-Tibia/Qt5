find the meaning.

\badcode
   include(compat.qdocconf)

\b Notes:

\badcode
   include(compat.qdocconf)
\endcode

For compatibility with older versions of QDoc, it is recommended
to include compat.qdocconf.

\code
   outputdir   = html
\endcode

QDoc will put the documentation generated in the html directory.

\badcode
   headerdirs  = .
\endcode

The header file associated with the \e .cpp source files can be found in the
current directory.

\badcode
   sourcedirs  = .
\endcode

The current directory is the directory containing the source files: the \e .cpp
and \e .qdoc files used in the documentation.

\badcode
   exampledirs = .
\endcode

The source code of the example files can be found in the current directory.

\badcode
   imagedirs   = ./images
\endcode

The image files can be found in the underlying directory \c images.
