    \class QVector3D
    \brief The QVector3D class represents a vector or vertex in 3D space.
    \since 4.6
    \ingroup painting-3D

    Vectors are one of the main building blocks of 3D representation and
    drawing.  They consist of three coordinates, traditionally called
    x, y, and z.

    The QVector3D class can also be used to represent vertices in 3D space.
    We therefore do not need to provide a separate vertex class.

    \note By design values in the QVector3D instance are stored as \c float.
    This means that on platforms where the \c qreal arguments to QVector3D
    functions are represented by \c double values, it is possible to
    lose precision.
