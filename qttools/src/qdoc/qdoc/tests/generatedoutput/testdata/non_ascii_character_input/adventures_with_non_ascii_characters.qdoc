    \title Adventures with non-ascii characters in QDoc
    \brief Test that non-ascii characters work as input to QDoc commands.

    The purpose of this test data is to provide a regression mechanism as part
    of QDoc's end-to-end test, tst_generatedOutput, for an issue (QTBUG-64506)
    that was reported against QDoc's \\section1 command. The issue, as
    experienced by the reporter of the bug, is that if the \\section1 command
    is followed by a non-ascii character (for example Chinese characters),
    navigation links aren't generated for the section title. The bug was filed
    against Qt 5.9.2. This test case aims at reproducing the issue as filed by
    the reporter.

    Such this document snippet:

    \section1 A 大纲视图
    The reporter states that this link works, presumably because it begins with
    the ascii character "A".

    这就是大纲视图

    \section1 3D场景视图
    The reporter states that this link works, presumably because it begins with
    the digit "3".

    这就是3D场景视图

    \section1 这就是3D场景视图
    If this section generates a duplicate anchor, "3D", it's because 3D
    is the only part of the section title QDoc recognizes. This is an error
    caused by the same bug, and the link should somehow reflect that QDoc
    encountered the Chinese (or any non-ascii) characters instead.

    \section1 属性视图
    The reporter states that this link doesn't work, presumably because it
    begins with the Chinese character "属".

    这就是属性视图

    \section1 Further details
    The bug report is at \l https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-64506. It
    contains the content used to trigger the behavior in this test case. The
    Chinese characters are copied verbatim from the report.

    \section2 Ascii characters that are non-printable ascii, such as ß, ü, or ø
    A whole range of ascii characters are not printable ascii characters. These
    could also cause issues for QDoc. This section is here to confirm linking
    to such section titles works as expected. It's made a section2 to exercise
    the behavior for other section levels than 1.
