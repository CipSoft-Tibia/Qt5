    \title Adventures with QDoc's \\brief command
    \brief Test that the \\brief command doesn't eat content that follows it.
    \inmodule sometestgroup
    \keyword some_keyword

    The purpose of this test data is to provide a regression mechanism as part
    of QDoc's end-to-end test, tst_generatedOutput, for an issue (QTBUG-70959)
    that was reported against QDoc's \\keyword command. The issue, as
    experienced by the reporter of the bug, is that if the \\keyword command
    isn't followed by a new command, or is the last command in a paragraph,
    the following paragraph is "eaten". That means the entire paragraph is
    understood by QDoc as keywords and included as html meta information
    instead of as part of the rendered output.

    \section1 Further details
    The bug report is at \l https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-70959.
    It refers to a change that bypassed the issue by moving the \\keyword
    command, at \l https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtdoc/+/242033/.

    \title There's no end to the possibilities!
    \brief Another test that the \\brief command //! Doesn't contain a full stop.
    //! QDoc's CMD_BRIEF should issue a warning when it doesn't end with a full
    //! stop. However, if a \\brief is followed by a line comment (i.e. `//!`),
    //! the warning isn't issued. This is tied to how `CMD_BRIEF` performs
    //! macro expansion and command processing; in the case of line comments in
    //! the argument, the last character of the brief's atom isn't a full stop.
        isn't completely borked

    The brief for this page is:
    "Another test that the \\brief command isn't completely borked". Notice the
    lack of a trailing full stop in the brief. QDoc should generate a warning
    about that when generating HTML.
