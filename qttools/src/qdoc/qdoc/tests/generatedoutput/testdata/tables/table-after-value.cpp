    \brief Test that the \\table command can follow a \\value command.

    \section1 Background for this test content
    According to QTBUG-115720, whenever a \\value is followed by \\table, the
    contents of the two commands end up being merged. This is likely surprising.
    The bug report suggests a workaround, which is adding \\br between \\value
    and \\table.
