    \class QDesignerSettingsInterface

    \brief The QDesignerSettingsInterface provides an abstraction of QSettings to be used in \QD.

    \QD uses the QDesignerSettingsInterface to save and retrieve its settings.
    The default implementation in \QD is based on QSettings, using a file in .ini-format.
    IDE integrations can provide their own implementations that for
    example store the settings in a database instead of a file.

    The virtual functions are equivalent to the functions of the same name in the
    QSettings class.
