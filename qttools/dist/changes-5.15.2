 - [QTBUG-87802] qdoc: Fix broken links generated by \sincelist
   The combination of single-exec mode and outputting to subdirectories
   (offline mode) made \sincelist generate href's to new classes and
   functions that are missing the target subdirectory. This happened
   because we did not pass the relative node to the function(s) that
   generate that list - proper link resolution requires a check if the
   page containing the \sincelist command comes from a different doc
   module, and the relative node is used for that.
   The bug was: qdoc: \sincelist generates broken links in certain
   conditions
 - [QTBUG-84703] qdoc: DocBook generator: Correctly handle enum classes
   While commit 46f71fcc fixed handling of enum classes for the code
   parser and marker, the DocBook generator has some dedicated code that
   also needs to be amended.
   The bug was: qdoc: DocBook generator: scoped enums not handled
   correctly
 - [QTBUG-86988] qdoc: DocBook generator: Remove code for encoding special characters
   QXmlStreamWriter already handles this for us.
   The bug was: qdoc: DocBook output format: XML special characters are
   escaped twice
 - [QTBUG-86759] Revert "macdeployqt: Don't copy .prl files into the Resources folder"
   This was skipping other files from Resources/ as well, such as
   “en-GB.pak” and “QtWebEngineProcess”. This reverts commit
   aabba72f7965e06e2e6ed960d8cf8078249dac8c.
   The bug was: Missing QtWebEngineProcess Application in application
   frameworks
 - [QTBUG-84727] QtHelp: Fix documentsFor() when not using filter engine
   The bug was: QHelpIndexWidget does not emit documentActivated or
   documentsActivated
 - [QTBUG-86598] Assistant: fix build with QT_NO_CLIPBOARD
   The bug was: Assistant fails to compile if QT_NO_CLIPBOARD is defined
 - [QTBUG-86477] Fix static build of assistant
   The bug was: [REG 5.15.0->5.15.1] assistant not build when building
   whole Qt statically
 - [QTBUG-86293] winrtrunner: Remove Windows Phone support
   Windows Phone has not been supported for a while now. With newer
   Windows versions the functionality causes issues. On build 1909 the
   application hangs in CoUninitialize when called with --list-devices
   and in build 2004 the needed classes are not registered at all.
   The bug was: "winrtrunner --list-devices" hangs
 - [QTBUG-86188] qdoc: Fix incorrect loop when processing tagged \fn parameters
   This fixes ASSERT: "uint(i) < uint(size())" in file
   qt5/qtbase/src/corelib/text/qstring.h, line 1067
   The bug was: qdoc: Crash when using a tagged \fn command
