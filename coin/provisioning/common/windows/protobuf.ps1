# Here we build protobuf libraries for MinGW and MSVC.
# Since it's a c++ library we need both msvc and mingw because they mangle symbols differently.
# For MSVC it builds with both debug and release configurations because of the visual c++ runtime.
# For MinGW we only need one, so we only build with release.
# The function below takes care of the common part of building - invoking cmake,
# calling ninja and installing it to a directory which we set an environment variable to.
# Because we have two compilers we also have two env. vars. and then each
# config in CI has the Protobuf_ROOT set to the appropriate one.
