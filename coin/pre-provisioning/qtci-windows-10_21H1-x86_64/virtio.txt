Install virtio

Our vanilla images are pre-installed in VMware where we have networking available. In KVM we can
use the VMware installed vmxnet3 NIC to fetch VirtIO drivers, install them, and only then switch
to using the VirtIO NIC in KVM.

NOTE! Install these Virtio drivers in Opennebula when using Windows 10 20H2

* Mount virtio-win-0.1.185.iso by double clicking it.
* Right click 'E:\NetKVM\w10\amd64\netkvm.inf' and select Install
* Right click 'E:\Balloon\w10\amd64\balloon.inf' and select Install
* Right click 'E:\vioscsi\w10\amd64\vioscsi.inf' and select Install
* Right click 'E:\vioserial\w10\amd64\vioser.inf' and select Install
* Navigate to E:\guest-agent directory and double click qemu-ga-x86_64

Because vioscsi does not install the entries in windows registry before we actually
have a VirtIO device installed, and we can't boot with a VirtIO device before
the driver is installed, we have to blindly install the registry entries:

* Download https://bugreports.qt.io/secure/attachment/95685/95685_vioscsi.reg
    cache: http://ci-files01-hki.intra.qt.io/input/windows/virtio/vioscsi.reg

However, we've seen that the Owner in the registry can be wrong. This entry
sets it to oem11.inf, but we've seen it be oem10.inf in one case and it has
to be corrected so that it will boot from the VirtIO driver. This was found out
by having 2 devices installed simultaneously and having the drivers install
properly into the registry.

* Eject the mounting
* Remove downloaded virtio-win-0.1.171.iso
