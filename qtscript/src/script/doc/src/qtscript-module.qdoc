    \brief The Qt Script module provides classes for making Qt applications scriptable.

    The Qt Script module only provides core scripting facilities; the
    Qt Script Tools module provides additional Qt Script-related
    components that application developers may find useful.

    \include deprecation.qdocinc

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the
    following directive:

    \snippet code/doc_src_qtscript.cpp 0

    To link against the module, add this line to your \l {qmake Manual}{qmake} \c .pro file:

    \snippet code/doc_src_qtscript.pro 1

    For detailed information on how to make your application
    scriptable with Qt Script, see \l{Making Applications
    Scriptable}.

    \section1 License Information

    Qt Commercial Edition licensees that wish to distribute applications that
    use the Qt Script module need to be aware of their obligations under the
    GNU Library General Public License (LGPL).

    Developers using the Open Source Edition can choose to redistribute
    the module under the appropriate version of the GNU LGPL.

    Commercial customers that do not want to depend on LGPL code can
    consider using the QJSEngine and QJSValue classes in the Qt Qml module.
    These classes offer a similar but more narrow scripting API that is
    sufficient for most use cases and is not dependent on LGPL code.
