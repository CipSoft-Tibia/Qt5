    \title Qt Graphs
    \page qtgraphs-index.html
    \brief Provides functionality for 2D and 3D graphs.

    The Qt Graphs module enables you to visualize data in 2D and 3D graphs.
    In the 3D realm there is support for bar, scatter, and surface graphs.
    It's especially useful for visualizing depth maps and large quantities
    of rapidly changing data, such as data received from multiple sensors.
    The look and feel of graphs can be customized by using themes or by adding
    custom items and labels.

    In the 2D realm, there is support for bars, lines, and scatter graphs, and
    it is easily combinable with any other QML content.

    Qt Graphs is built on Qt 6 and the 3D graphs on Qt Quick 3D to take advantage of
    hardware acceleration and Qt Quick.

    \note This module is in Technical Preview

    \section2 Limiting Features

    In cases the target of an application is some embedded hardware with limited
    specifications, it is possible to build only 2D or 3D support into the module.

    For more information, see \l{Qt Graphs Configure Options}{configuring Qt Graphs}.
