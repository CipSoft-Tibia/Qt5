    \title Qt Graphs
    \page qtgraphs-index.html
    \brief Provides functionality for 3D graphs.

    The Qt Graphs module enables you to visualize data in 3D as
    bar, scatter, and surface graphs. It's especially useful for visualizing
    depth maps and large quantities of rapidly changing data, such as data
    received from multiple sensors. The look and feel of graphs can be
    customized by using themes or by adding custom items and labels.

    Qt Graphs is built on Qt 6 and Qt Quick 3D to take advantage of
    hardware acceleration and Qt Quick.
