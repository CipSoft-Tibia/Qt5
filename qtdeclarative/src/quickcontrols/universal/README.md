# Universal Style

This style is based on the [Microsoft Universal Design Guidelines](https://dev.windows.com/design).

The colors and metrics used all around the QML and C++ files originate from the Windows 10 SDK. The files are called **generic.xaml** and **themeresources.xml**, and they are located in the following folder:

    \(Program Files)\Windows Kits\10\DesignTime\CommonConfiguration\Neutral\UAP\<SDK version>\Generic
