    \brief Guidelines for navigation controls

    Qt Quick Controls offers a selection of navigation models.

    \annotatedlist qtquickcontrols-navigation

    The following sections offer guidelines for choosing the appropriate type
    of navigation model, depending on the use case.

    \section1 StackView Control

    \l StackView provides a stack-based navigation model which can be used
    with a set of interlinked pages. StackView works according to a last-in
    first-out principle: the page pushed last on the stack is the one visible.
    Popping a page removes the last page and makes the previous one visible.

    \section1 SwipeView Control

    \l SwipeView provides a navigation model that simplifies horizontal paged
    scrolling. The page indicator on the bottom shows which is the presently
    active page.

    \section1 TabBar Control

    between different subtasks, views, or modes.
