    \brief Guidelines for button controls

    Qt Quick Controls offers a selection of button-like controls.

    \annotatedlist qtquickcontrols-buttons

    Each type of button has its own specific use case. The following
    sections offer guidelines for choosing the appropriate type of button,
    depending on the use case.

    \section1 Button Control

    \l Button is a clickable control that starts an action, or opens or
    closes a popup. A button usually has a text label but it can also
    contain an icon.

    Button is a very suitable control when a popup or dialog needs
    to perform an action. The most common examples are Apply, Cancel,
    Save, Close and Help.

    Recommendations:

    \list
    \li The button's text should be a verb describing the action, or a noun matching
        the title of the popup that will be opened.
    \li Don't use a button to set state. \l Switch is more suitable for that.
    \li Use the default font unless you have UI guidelines specifying otherwise.
    \li If the text is localized, consider the influence of a longer text on the layout.
    \endlist

    \section1 CheckBox Control

    \image qtquickcontrols-checkbox.gif

    \l CheckBox is used to build multi-selection option lists. Any number of
    options can be selected, including none, but the options should
    not be mutually exclusive.

    Use a single CheckBox for a yes/no choice, such as when you have
    to accept the terms of service agreement in a form.

    For a single yes/no choice, it is also possible to use a switch. If the choice
    concerns an option, it is best to use a CheckBox. If it concerns action to
    be taken, a switch is recommended.

    When options can be grouped, you can use a partially checked CheckBox to
    represent the whole group. Use the checkbox's
    \l {CheckBox::checkState}{partially checked state} when a user selects
    some, but not all, sub-items in the group.

    The three availables check states are: checked, partially checked and
    unchecked.

    The checkable options are often listed vertically.

    Recommendations:
    \list
    \li The checkbox label should be a statement that the check mark makes true,
    and that the absence of a check mark makes false.
    \li The checkbox label should not contain a negative statement.
    \li Use the default font, unless you have UI guidelines specifying otherwise.
    \li If the text is localized, consider the influence of a longer text on the layout.
    \endlist

    \section1 DelayButton Control

    \l DelayButton is a button that incorporates a delay before triggering an action.
    This delay prevents accidental presses.

    Recommendations:
    \list
    \li Use in touch user interfaces.
    \li Use for actions that must be triggered with care.
    \endlist

    \b {See also} \l Button and \l AbstractButton

    \section1 RadioButton Control

    \image qtquickcontrols-radiobutton.gif

    \l RadioButton is used to select only one option from a set of options.
    Selecting one option automatically deselects the one selected before.

    If there are only two mutually exclusive options, combine them into a
    single checkbox or a switch.

    Recommendations:

    \list
    \li Limit the label text to one line.
    \li Ensure that a sensible default option is checked.
    \li List RadioButton options vertically.
    \li If the text is localized, consider the influence of a longer text on the layout.
    \li Use the default font, unless you have UI guidelines that specify otherwise.
    \li Just like with CheckBox, do not make the list too large.
    \li In order to avoid confusion, do not put two groups of radio buttons next to each
        other.
    \endlist

    \b {See also} \l RadioButton

    \section1 RoundButton Control

    \l RoundButton is a clickable control that starts an action, or opens or
    closes a popup. A round button with a square image icon or one-letter font
    icon is circular. A circular RoundButton takes less space than a normal
    \l Button, and can also be used as a floating action button.

    Recommendations:

    \list
    \li Keep labels short and concise.
    \li If the text is localized, consider the influence of a longer text on the layout.
    \endlist

    \b {See also} \l RoundButton

    \section1 Switch Control

    \image qtquickcontrols-switch.png

    \l Switch represents a physical switch that allows users to choose between an "on"
    or "off" state.
    Use a switch for binary operations that take effect immediately after it has been
    switched on. For example, a switch to turn WIFI on or off.

    Recommendations:

    \list
    \li Keep labels short and concise.
    \li If the text is localized, consider the influence of a longer text on the layout.
    \endlist

    \b {See also} \l Switch

    \section1 ToolButton Control

    \image qtquickcontrols-toolbutton.png

    \l ToolButton is nearly identical to \l Button, but it has a graphical
    appearance that makes it more suitable for insertion into a \l ToolBar.
