    \brief Guidelines for container controls

    Qt Quick Controls offers a selection of container-like controls.

    \annotatedlist qtquickcontrols-containers

    Each type of container can be used to group a set of controls together.
    The following sections offer guidelines for choosing the appropriate type
    of container, depending on the use case.

    \section1 ApplicationWindow Control

    \l ApplicationWindow creates the root window of an application, and makes
    it easy to add an optional header and footer to that window.

    \section1 Frame Control

    \l Frame is used to layout a logical group of controls together, within
    a visual frame.

    \section1 GroupBox Control

    \l GroupBox is used to layout a logical group of controls together,
    within a titled visual frame.

    \section1 Page Control

    \l Page provides page-specific header and footer items.
    It is perfectly possible to use ApplicationWindow for setting the header
    and the footer, but if you have a header and footer which varies per
    screen, then it is better to use \l Page.

    \section1 Pane Control

    \l Pane provides a background color that matches with the application
    style and theme. Pane does not provide a layout of its own, but requires
    you to position its contents, for instance by using a \l RowLayout or
    a \l ColumnLayout.

    \section1 ScrollView Control

    \l ScrollView provides scrolling for user-defined content.

    \section1 StackView Control

    \image qtquickcontrols-stackview-wireframe.png

    \l StackView organizes content pages into a stack using a last-in-first-out
    principle: the last item to be "pushed" onto the stack is the first one to
    be removed, and the top-most item is always the one that is visible.

    \section1 SwipeView Control

    \l SwipeView organizes content pages into a swipable strip.

    \section1 TabBar Control

    \image qtquickcontrols-tabbar-wireframe.png

    \l TabBar organizes content pages into tabs.

    \section1 ToolBar Control

    \l ToolBar is a container of application-wide and context-sensitive
    actions and controls.
