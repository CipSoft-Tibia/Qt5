//! [position]

This property holds the logical position of the thumb indicator.

The position is expressed as a fraction of the indicator's size, in the range
\c 0.0 - \c 1.0. The position can be used for example to determine whether
the thumb has been dragged past the halfway point. For visualizing a thumb
indicator, the right-to-left aware \l visualPosition should be used instead.

\sa visualPosition

//! [position]


//! [visualPosition]

This property holds the visual position of the thumb indicator.

The position is expressed as a fraction of the indicator's size, in the range
\c 0.0 - \c 1.0. When the control is \l {Control::mirrored}{mirrored}, the
value is equal to \c {1.0 - position}. This makes the value suitable for
visualizing the thumb indicator taking right-to-left support into account.
In order to for example determine whether the thumb has been dragged past
the halfway point, the logical \l position should be used instead.
