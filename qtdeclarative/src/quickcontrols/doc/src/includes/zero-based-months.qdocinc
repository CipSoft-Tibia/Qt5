The Qt Quick Calendar module uses 0-based month numbers to be consistent
with the JavaScript Date type, that is used by the QML language. This
means that \c Date::getMonth() can be passed to the methods as is. When
dealing with month numbers directly, it is highly recommended to use the
following enumeration values to avoid confusion.

\value Calendar.January January (0)
\value Calendar.February February (1)
\value Calendar.March March (2)
\value Calendar.April April (3)
\value Calendar.May May (4)
\value Calendar.June June (5)
\value Calendar.July July (6)
\value Calendar.August August (7)
\value Calendar.September September (8)
\value Calendar.October October (9)
\value Calendar.November November (10)
\value Calendar.December December (11)
