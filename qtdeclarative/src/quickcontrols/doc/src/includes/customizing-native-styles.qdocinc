It is instead recommended to always base a customized control on top of a single style
that is available on all platforms, e.g \l {Basic Style}, \l {Fusion Style}, \l {Imagine Style},
\l {Material Style}, \l {Universal Style}. By doing so, you are guaranteed that it will
always look the same, regardless of which style the application is run with. To learn how
to use a different style, see \l {Using Styles in Qt Quick Controls}. Alternatively,
you can \l {Creating a Custom Style}{create your own style}.
