//! [flags]
The value is a bit-wise combination of flags or \c Qt.ImhNone if no hints are set.

Flags that alter behavior are:

\list
\li Qt.ImhHiddenText - Characters should be hidden, as is typically used when entering passwords.
\li Qt.ImhSensitiveData - Typed text should not be stored by the active input method
        in any persistent storage like predictive user dictionary.
\li Qt.ImhNoAutoUppercase - The input method should not try to automatically switch to upper case
        when a sentence ends.
\li Qt.ImhPreferNumbers - Numbers are preferred (but not required).
\li Qt.ImhPreferUppercase - Upper case letters are preferred (but not required).
\li Qt.ImhPreferLowercase - Lower case letters are preferred (but not required).
\li Qt.ImhNoPredictiveText - Do not use predictive text (i.e. dictionary lookup) while typing.

\li Qt.ImhDate - The text editor functions as a date field.
\li Qt.ImhTime - The text editor functions as a time field.
\endlist

Flags that restrict input (exclusive flags) are:

\list
\li Qt.ImhDigitsOnly - Only digits are allowed.
\li Qt.ImhFormattedNumbersOnly - Only number input is allowed. This includes decimal point and minus sign.
\li Qt.ImhUppercaseOnly - Only upper case letter input is allowed.
\li Qt.ImhLowercaseOnly - Only lower case letter input is allowed.
\li Qt.ImhDialableCharactersOnly - Only characters suitable for phone dialing are allowed.
\li Qt.ImhEmailCharactersOnly - Only characters suitable for email addresses are allowed.
\li Qt.ImhUrlCharactersOnly - Only characters suitable for URLs are allowed.
\endlist

Masks:

\list
\li Qt.ImhExclusiveInputMask - This mask yields nonzero if any of the exclusive flags are used.
\endlist
