\note If the background item has no explicit size specified, it automatically
      follows the control's size. In most cases, there is no need to specify
      width or height for a background item.

\note Most controls use the implicit size of the background item to calculate
the implicit size of the control itself. If you replace the background item
with a custom one, you should also consider providing a sensible implicit
size for it (unless it is an item like \l Image which has its own implicit
size).
