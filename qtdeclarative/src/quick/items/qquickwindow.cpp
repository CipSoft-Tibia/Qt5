Focus behavior
==============

Prior to being added to a valid window items can set and clear focus with no
effect.  Only once items are added to a window (by way of having a parent set that
already belongs to a window) do the focus rules apply.  Focus goes back to
having no effect if an item is removed from a window.

When an item is moved into a new focus scope (either being added to a window
for the first time, or having its parent changed), if the focus scope already has
a scope focused item that takes precedence over the item being added.  Otherwise,
the focus of the added tree is used.  In the case of a tree of items being
added to a window for the first time, which may have a conflicted focus state (two
or more items in one scope having focus set), the same rule is applied item by item -
thus the first item that has focus will get it (assuming the scope doesn't already
have a scope focused item), and the other items will have their focus cleared.

    A "polish loop" can occur inside QQuickWindowPrivate::polishItems(). It is when an item calls
    polish() on an(other?) item from updatePolish(). If this anomaly happens repeatedly and without
    interruption (of a well-behaved updatePolish() that doesn't call polish()), it is a strong
    indication that we are heading towards an infinite polish loop. A polish loop is not a bug in
    Qt Quick - it is a bug caused by ill-behaved items put in the scene.

    We can detect this sequence of polish loops easily, since the
    QQuickWindowPrivate::itemsToPolish is basically a stack: polish() will push to it, and
    polishItems() will pop from it.
    Therefore if updatePolish() calls polish(), the immediate next item polishItems() processes is
    the item that was polished by the previous call to updatePolish().
    We therefore just need to count the number of polish loops we detected in _sequence_.

    \brief Creates a new top-level window.

    The Window object creates a new top-level window for a Qt Quick scene. It automatically sets up the
    window for use with \c {QtQuick} graphical types.

    A Window can be declared inside an Item or inside another Window, in which
    case the inner Window will automatically become "transient for" the outer
    Window, with the outer Window as its \l transientParent. Most platforms will
    show the Window centered upon the outer window in this case, and there may be
    other platform-dependent behaviors, depending also on the \l flags. If the nested
    window is intended to be a dialog in your application, you should also set \l flags
    to \c Qt.Dialog, because some window managers will not provide the centering behavior
    without that flag.

    You can also declare multiple windows inside a top-level \l QtObject, in which
    case the windows will have no transient relationship.

    Alternatively you can set or bind \l x and \l y to position the Window
    explicitly on the screen.

    When the user attempts to close a window, the \l closing signal will be
    emitted. You can force the window to stay open (for example to prompt the
    user to save changes) by writing an \c onClosing handler that sets
    \c {close.accepted = false} unless it's safe to close the window (for example,
    because there are no more unsaved changes).

    \code
    onClosing: (close) => {
        if (document.changed) {
            close.accepted = false
            confirmExitPopup.open()
        }
    }

    // The confirmExitPopup allows user to save or discard the document,
    // or to cancel the closing.

    \class QQuickWindow
    \since 5.0

    \inmodule QtQuick

    \brief The QQuickWindow class provides the window for displaying a graphical QML scene.

    QQuickWindow provides the graphical scene management needed to interact with and display
    a scene of QQuickItems.

    A QQuickWindow always has a single invisible root item. To add items to this window,
    reparent the items to the root item or to an existing item in the scene.

    For easily displaying a scene from a QML file, see \l{QQuickView}.

    \section1 Rendering

    QQuickWindow uses a scene graph to represent what needs to be rendered.
    This scene graph is disconnected from the QML scene and potentially lives in
    another thread, depending on the platform implementation. Since the
    rendering scene graph lives independently from the QML scene, it can also be
    completely released without affecting the state of the QML scene.

    The sceneGraphInitialized() signal is emitted on the rendering thread before
    the QML scene is rendered to the screen for the first time. If the rendering
    scene graph has been released, the signal will be emitted again before the
    next frame is rendered. A visible, on-screen QQuickWindow is driven
    internally by a \c{render loop}, of which there are multiple implementations
    provided in the scene graph. For details on the scene graph rendering
    process, see \l{Qt Quick Scene Graph}.

    By default, a QQuickWindow renders using an accelerated 3D graphics API,
    such as OpenGL or Vulkan. See \l{Scene Graph Adaptations} for a detailed
    overview of scene graph backends and the supported graphics APIs.

    \warning It is crucial that graphics operations and interaction with the
    scene graph happens exclusively on the rendering thread, primarily during
    the updatePaintNode() phase.

    \warning As many of the signals related to rendering are emitted from the
    rendering thread, connections should be made using Qt::DirectConnection.

    \section2 Integration with Accelerated 3D Graphics APIs

    It is possible to integrate OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, or Direct3D 11 calls
    directly into the QQuickWindow, as long as the QQuickWindow and the
    underlying scene graph is rendering using the same API. To access native
    graphics objects, such as device or context object handles, use
    QSGRendererInterface. An instance of QSGRendererInterface is queriable from
    QQuickWindow by calling rendererInterface(). The enablers for this
    integration are the beforeRendering(), beforeRenderPassRecording(),
    afterRenderPassRecording(), and related signals. These allow rendering
    underlays or overlays. Alternatively, QNativeInterface::QSGOpenGLTexture,
    QNativeInterface::QSGVulkanTexture, and other similar classes allow
    wrapping an existing native texture or image object in a QSGTexture that
    can then be used with the scene graph.

    \section2 Rendering without Acceleration

    A limited, pure software based rendering path is available as well. With the
    \c software backend, a number of Qt Quick features are not available, QML
    items relying on these will not be rendered at all. At the same time, this
    allows QQuickWindow to be functional even on systems where there is no 3D
    graphics API available at all. See \l{Qt Quick Software Adaptation} for more
    details.

    \section2 Redirected Rendering

    A QQuickWindow is not necessarily backed by a native window on screen. The
    rendering can be redirected to target a custom render target, such as a
    given native texture. This is achieved in combination with the
    QQuickRenderControl class, and functions such as setRenderTarget(),
    setGraphicsDevice(), and setGraphicsConfiguration().

    In this case, the QQuickWindow represents the scene, and provides the
    intrastructure for rendering a frame. It will not be backed by a render
    loop and a native window. Instead, in this case the application drives
    rendering, effectively substituting for the render loops. This allows
    generating image sequences, rendering into textures for use in external 3D
    engines, or rendering Qt Quick content within a VR environment.

    \section2 Resource Management

    QML will try to cache images and scene graph nodes to improve performance,
    but in some low-memory scenarios it might be required to aggressively
    release these resources. The releaseResources() function can be used to
    force the clean up of certain resources, especially resource that are cached
    and can be recreated later when needed again.

    Additionally, calling releaseResources() may result in releasing the entire
    scene graph and the associated graphics resources. The
    sceneGraphInvalidated() signal will be emitted when this happens. This
    behavior is controlled by the setPersistentGraphics() and
    setPersistentSceneGraph() functions.

    \note All classes with QSG prefix should be used solely on the scene graph's
    rendering thread. See \l {Scene Graph and Rendering} for more information.

    \section2 Exposure and Visibility

    When a QQuickWindow instance is deliberately hidden with hide() or
    setVisible(false), it will stop rendering and its scene graph and graphics
    context might be released as well. This depends on the settings configured
    by setPersistentGraphics() and setPersistentSceneGraph(). The behavior in
    this respect is identical to explicitly calling the releaseResources()
    function. A window can become not exposed, in other words non-renderable, by
    other means as well. This depends on the platform and windowing system. For
    example, on Windows minimizing a window makes it stop rendering.  On \macos
    fully obscuring a window by other windows on top triggers the same. On
    Linux/X11, the behavior is dependent on the window manager.

    \section2 OpenGL Context and Surface Formats

    While it is possible to specify a QSurfaceFormat for every QQuickWindow by
    calling the member function setFormat(), windows may also be created from
    QML by using the Window and ApplicationWindow elements. In this case there
    is no C++ code involved in the creation of the window instance, yet
    applications may still wish to set certain surface format values, for
    example to request a given OpenGL version or profile. Such applications can
    call the static function QSurfaceFormat::setDefaultFormat() at startup. The
    specified format will be used for all Quick windows created afterwards.

    \section2 Vulkan Instance

    When using Vulkan, a QQuickWindow is automatically associated with a
    QVulkanInstance that is created and managed internally by the scene graph.
    This way most applications do not need to worry about having a \c
    VkInstance available since it all happens automatically. In advanced cases
    an application may wish to create its own QVulkanInstance, in order to
    configure it in a specific way. That is possible as well. Calling
    \l{QWindow::setVulkanInstance()}{setVulkanInstance()} on the QQuickWindow
    right after construction, before making it visible, leads to using the
    application-supplied QVulkanInstance (and the underlying \c VkInstance).
    When redirecting via QQuickRenderControl, there is no QVulkanInstance
    provided automatically, but rather the application is expected to provide
    its own and associate it with the QQuickWindow.

    \section2 Graphics Contexts and Devices

    When the scene graph is initialized, which typically happens when the
    window becomes exposed or, in case of redirected rendering, initialization
    is performed \l{QQuickRenderControl::initialize()}{via
    QQuickRenderControl}, the context or device objects necessary for rendering
    are created automatically. This includes OpenGL contexts, Direct3D devices
    and device contexts, Vulkan and Metal devices. These are also queriable by
    application code afterwards via
    \l{QSGRendererInterface::getResource()}{QSGRendererInterface}. When using
    the \c basic render loop, which performs all rendering on the GUI thread,
    the same context or device is used with all visible QQuickWindows. The \c
    threaded render loop uses a dedicated context or device object for each
    rendering thread, and so for each QQuickWindow. With some graphics APIs,
    there is a degree of customizability provided via
    setGraphicsConfiguration(). This makes it possible, for example, to specify
    the list of Vulkan extensions to enable on the \c VkDevice. Alternatively,
    it is also possible to provide a set of existing context or device objects
    for use by the QQuickWindow, instead of letting it construct its own. This
    is achieved through setGraphicsDevice().

            3) During delivery to either subscene, an item in the subscene grabs.
            4) The user moves finger(s) generating a move event: the correct grabber item needs to get the update
            via the same subscene delivery agent from which it got the press, so that the coord transform will be done properly.
            5) Likewise with the touchpoint releases.

    \qmlproperty list<QtObject> Window::data
    \qmldefault

    The data property allows you to freely mix visual children, resources
    and other Windows in a Window.

    If you assign another Window to the data list, the nested window will
    become "transient for" the outer Window.

    If you assign an \l Item to the data list, it becomes a child of the
    Window's \l contentItem, so that it appears inside the window. The item's
    parent will be the window's contentItem, which is the root of the Item
    ownership tree within that Window.

    If you assign any other object type, it is added as a resource.

    It should not generally be necessary to refer to the \c data property,
    as it is the default property for Window and thus all child items are
    automatically assigned to this property.

    Sets the render target for this window to be \a target.

    A QQuickRenderTarget serves as an opaque handle for a renderable native
    object, most commonly a 2D texture, and associated metadata, such as the
    size in pixels.

    A default constructed QQuickRenderTarget means no redirection. A valid
    \a target, created via one of the static QQuickRenderTarget factory functions,
    on the other hand, enables redirection of the rendering of the Qt Quick
    scene: it will no longer target the color buffers for the surface
    associated with the window, but rather the textures or other graphics
    objects specified in \a target.

    For example, assuming the scenegraph is using Vulkan to render, one can
    redirect its output into a \c VkImage. For graphics APIs like Vulkan, the
    image layout must be provided as well. QQuickRenderTarget instances are
    implicitly shared and are copyable and can be passed by value. They do not
    own the associated native objects (such as, the VkImage in the example),
    however.

    \badcode
        QQuickRenderTarget rt = QQuickRenderTarget::fromVulkanImage(vulkanImage, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED, pixelSize);
        quickWindow->setRenderTarget(rt);
    \endcode

    This function is very often used in combination with QQuickRenderControl
    and an invisible QQuickWindow, in order to render Qt Quick content into a
    texture, without creating an on-screen native window for this QQuickWindow.

    When the desired target, or associated data, such as the size, changes,
    call this function with a new QQuickRenderTarget. Constructing
    QQuickRenderTarget instances and calling this function is cheap, but be
    aware that setting a new \a target with a different native object or other
    data may lead to potentially expensive initialization steps when the
    scenegraph is about to render the next frame. Therefore change the target
    only when necessary.

    \note The window does not take ownership of any native objects referenced
    in \a target.

    \note It is the caller's responsibility to ensure the native objects
    referred to in \a target are valid for the scenegraph renderer too. For
    instance, with Vulkan, Metal, and Direct3D this implies that the texture or
    image is created on the same graphics device that is used by the scenegraph
    internally. Therefore, when texture objects created on an already existing
    device or context are involved, this function is often used in combination
    with setGraphicsDevice().

    \note With graphics APIs where relevant, the application must pay attention
    to image layout transitions performed by the scenegraph. For example, once
    a VkImage is associated with the scenegraph by calling this function, its
    layout will transition to \c VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL when
    rendering a frame.

/*!
    Creates a new QSGTexture from the supplied \a image. If the image has an
    alpha channel, the corresponding texture will have an alpha channel.

    The caller of the function is responsible for deleting the returned texture.
    The underlying native texture object is then destroyed together with the
    QSGTexture.

    When \a options contains TextureCanUseAtlas, the engine may put the image
    into a texture atlas. Textures in an atlas need to rely on
    QSGTexture::normalizedTextureSubRect() for their geometry and will not
    support QSGTexture::Repeat. Other values from CreateTextureOption are
    ignored.

    When \a options contains TextureIsOpaque, the engine will create an RGB
    texture which returns false for QSGTexture::hasAlphaChannel(). Opaque
    textures will in most cases be faster to render. When this flag is not set,
    the texture will have an alpha channel based on the image's format.

    When \a options contains TextureHasMipmaps, the engine will create a texture
    which can use mipmap filtering. Mipmapped textures can not be in an atlas.

    Setting TextureHasAlphaChannel in \a options serves no purpose for this
    function since assuming an alpha channel and blending is the default. To opt
    out, set TextureIsOpaque.

    When the scene graph uses OpenGL, the returned texture will be using \c
    GL_TEXTURE_2D as texture target and \c GL_RGBA as internal format. With
    other graphics APIs, the texture format is typically \c RGBA8. Reimplement
    QSGTexture to create textures with different parameters.

    \warning This function will return 0 if the scene graph has not yet been
    initialized.

    \warning The returned texture is not memory managed by the scene graph and
    must be explicitly deleted by the caller on the rendering thread. This is
    achieved by deleting the texture from a QSGNode destructor or by using
    deleteLater() in the case where the texture already has affinity to the

    flag can save the cost of performing alpha blending during rendering. The

    of the QRhiTexture, i.e. not setting the flag while having a texture format
    such as the commonly used \l QRhiTexture::RGBA8 is perfectly normal.

    Mipmapping is not controlled by \a options since \a texture is already

    \variable QQuickWindow::GraphicsStateInfo::currentFrameSlot
    \since 5.14
    \brief the current frame slot index while recording a frame.

    When the scenegraph renders with lower level 3D APIs such as Vulkan or
    Metal, it is the Qt's responsibility to ensure blocking whenever starting a
    new frame and finding the CPU is already a certain number of frames ahead
    of the GPU (because the command buffer submitted in frame no. \c{current} -
    \c{FramesInFlight} has not yet completed). With other graphics APIs, such
    as OpenGL or Direct 3D 11 this level of control is not exposed to the API
    client but rather handled by the implementation of the graphics API.

    By extension, this also means that the appropriate double (or triple)
    buffering of resources, such as buffers, is up to the graphics API client
    to manage. Most commonly, a uniform buffer where the data changes between
    frames cannot simply change its contents when submitting a frame, given
    that the frame may still be active ("in flight") when starting to record
    the next frame. To avoid stalling the pipeline, one way is to have multiple
    buffers (and memory allocations) under the hood, thus realizing at least a
    double buffered scheme for such resources.

    Applications that integrate rendering done directly with a graphics API
    such as Vulkan may want to perform a similar double or triple buffering of
    their own graphics resources, in a way that is compatible with the Qt
    rendering engine's frame submission process. That then involves knowing the
    values for the maximum number of in-flight frames (which is typically 2 or
    3) and the current frame slot index, which is a number running 0, 1, ..,
    FramesInFlight-1, and then wrapping around. The former is exposed in the
    \l{QQuickWindow::GraphicsStateInfo::framesInFlight}{framesInFlight}
    variable. The latter, current index, is this value.

    For an example of using these values in practice, refer to the {Scene Graph
    - Vulkan Under QML} and {Scene Graph - Vulkan Texture Import} examples.

    When mixing raw graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, etc.) commands with scene
    graph rendering, it is necessary to call this function before recording

    In practice this function is often called from a slot connected to the
    beforeRenderPassRecording() or afterRenderPassRecording() signals.

    The function does not need to be called when recording commands to the
    application's own command buffer (such as, a VkCommandBuffer or
    MTLCommandBuffer + MTLRenderCommandEncoder created and managed by the
    application, not retrieved from the scene graph). With graphics APIs where
    no native command buffer concept is exposed (OpenGL, Direct 3D 11),

    replacement for the Qt 5 resetOpenGLState() function.

    Calling this function and endExternalCommands() is not necessary within the

    nodes.

    when the underlying implementation provides a dedicated secondary command
    buffer for recording external graphics commands within a render pass.
    Therefore, always query CommandListResource after calling this function. Do
    not attempt to reuse an object from an earlier query.

    \note When the scenegraph is using OpenGL, pay attention to the fact that
    the OpenGL state in the context can have arbitrary settings, and this

    Schedules \a job to run when the rendering of this window reaches
    the given \a stage.

    This is a convenience to the equivalent signals in QQuickWindow for
    "one shot" tasks.

    The window takes ownership over \a job and will delete it when the
    job is completed.

    If rendering is shut down before \a job has a chance to run, the
    job will be run and then deleted as part of the scene graph cleanup.
    If the window is never shown and no rendering happens before the QQuickWindow
    is destroyed, all pending jobs will be destroyed without their run()
    method being called.

    If the rendering is happening on a different thread, then the job
    will happen on the rendering thread.

    If \a stage is \l NoStage, \a job will be run at the earliest opportunity
    whenever the render thread is not busy rendering a frame. If the window is
    not exposed, and is not renderable, at the time the job is either posted or
    handled, the job is deleted without executing the run() method.  If a
    non-threaded renderer is in use, the run() method of the job is executed
    synchronously. When rendering with OpenGL, the OpenGL context is changed to
    the renderer's context before executing any job, including \l NoStage jobs.

    \note This function does not trigger rendering; the jobs targeting any other
    stage than NoStage will be stored run until rendering is triggered elsewhere.
    To force the job to run earlier, call QQuickWindow::update();

    Requests the specified graphics \a api.

    When the built-in, default graphics adaptation is used, \a api specifies
    which graphics API (OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal, or Direct3D) the scene graph
    should use to render. In addition, the \c software backend is built-in as
    well, and can be requested by setting \a api to
    QSGRendererInterface::Software.

    Unlike setSceneGraphBackend(), which can only be used to request a given
    backend (shipped either built-in or installed as dynamically loaded
    plugins), this function works with the higher level concept of graphics
    APIs. It covers the backends that ship with Qt Quick, and thus have
    corresponding values in the QSGRendererInterface::GraphicsApi enum.

    When this function is not called at all, and the equivalent environment
    variable \c{QSG_RHI_BACKEND} is not set either, the scene graph will choose
    the graphics API to use based on the platform.

    This function becomes important in applications that are only prepared for
    rendering with a given API. For example, if there is native OpenGL or
    Vulkan rendering done by the application, it will want to ensure Qt Quick
    is rendering using OpenGL or Vulkan too. Such applications are expected to
    call this function early in their main() function.

    \note The call to the function must happen before constructing the first
    QQuickWindow in the application. The graphics API cannot be changed
    afterwards.

    \note When used in combination with QQuickRenderControl, this rule is
    relaxed: it is possible to change the graphics API, but only when all
    existing QQuickRenderControl and QQuickWindow instances have been
    destroyed.

    To query what graphics API the scene graph is using to render,
    QSGRendererInterface::graphicsApi() after the scene graph
    \l{QQuickWindow::isSceneGraphInitialized()}{has initialized}, which
    typically happens either when the window becomes visible for the first time, or
    when QQuickRenderControl::initialize() is called.

    To switch back to the default behavior, where the scene graph chooses a
    graphics API based on the platform and other conditions, set \a api to

    \return the graphics API that would be used by the scene graph if it was
    initialized at this point in time.

    The standard way to query the API used by the scene graph is to use
    QSGRendererInterface::graphicsApi() once the scene graph has initialized,
    for example when or after the sceneGraphInitialized() signal is emitted. In
    that case one gets the true, real result, because then it is known that
    everything was initialized correctly using that graphics API.

    This is not always convenient. If the application needs to set up external
    frameworks, or needs to work with setGraphicsDevice() in a manner that
    depends on the scene graph's built in API selection logic, it is not always
    feasiable to defer such operations until after the QQuickWindow has been
    made visible or QQuickRenderControl::initialize() has been called.

    Therefore, this static function is provided as a counterpart to
    setGraphicsApi(): it can be called at any time, and the result reflects
    what API the scene graph would choose if it was initialized at the point of
    the call.

    \note This static function is intended to be called on the main (GUI)
    thread only. For querying the API when rendering, use QSGRendererInterface
    since that object lives on the render thread.

    Sets the graphics device objects for this window. The scenegraph will use
    existing device, physical device, and other objects specified by \a device
    instead of creating new ones.

    This function is very often used in combination with QQuickRenderControl
    and setRenderTarget(), in order to redirect Qt Quick rendering into a
    texture.

    A default constructed QQuickGraphicsDevice does not change the default
    behavior in any way. Once a \a device created via one of the
    QQuickGraphicsDevice factory functions, such as,
    QQuickGraphicsDevice::fromDeviceObjects(), is passed in, and the scenegraph
    uses a matching graphics API (with the example of fromDeviceObjects(), that
    would be Vulkan), the scenegraph will use the existing device objects (such
    as, the \c VkPhysicalDevice, \c VkDevice, and graphics queue family index,
    in case of Vulkan) encapsulated by the QQuickGraphicsDevice. This allows
    using the same device, and so sharing resources, such as buffers and
    textures, between Qt Quick and native rendering engines.

    \warning This function can only be called before initializing the
    scenegraph and will have no effect if called afterwards. In practice this
    typically means calling it right before QQuickRenderControl::initialize().

    As an example, this time with Direct3D, the typical usage is expected to be
    the following:

    \badcode
        // native graphics resources set up by a custom D3D rendering engine
        ID3D11Device *device;
        ID3D11DeviceContext *context;
        ID3D11Texture2D *texture;
        ...
        // now to redirect Qt Quick content into 'texture' we could do the following:
        QQuickRenderControl *renderControl = new QQuickRenderControl;
        QQuickWindow *window = new QQuickWindow(renderControl); // this window will never be shown on-screen
        ...
        window->setGraphicsDevice(QQuickGraphicsDevice::fromDeviceAndContext(device, context));
        renderControl->initialize();
        window->setRenderTarget(QQuickRenderTarget::fromD3D11Texture(texture, textureSize);
        ...
    \endcode

    The key aspect of using this function is to ensure that resources or
    handles to resources, such as \c texture in the above example, are visible
    to and usable by both the external rendering engine and the scenegraph
    renderer. This requires using the same graphics device (or with OpenGL,
    OpenGL context).

    QQuickGraphicsDevice instances are implicitly shared, copyable, and
    can be passed by value. They do not own the associated native objects (such
    as, the ID3D11Device in the example).

    \note Using QQuickRenderControl does not always imply having to call this
    function. When adopting an existing device or context is not needed, this
    function should not be called, and the scene graph will then initialize its
    own devices and contexts normally, just as it would with an on-screen
    QQuickWindow.
