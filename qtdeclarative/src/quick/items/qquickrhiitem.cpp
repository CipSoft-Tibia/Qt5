    \class QQuickRhiItem
    \inmodule QtQuick
    \since 6.7

    \brief The QQuickRhiItem class is a portable alternative to
    QQuickFramebufferObject that is not tied to OpenGL, but rather allows
    integrating rendering with the QRhi APIs with Qt Quick.

    \preliminary

    \note QQuickRhiItem is in tech preview in Qt 6.7. \b {The API is under
    development and subject to change.}

    QQuickRhiItem is effectively the counterpart of \l QRhiWidget in the world of
    Qt Quick. Both of these are meant to be subclassed, and they both enable
    recording QRhi-based rendering that targets an offscreen color buffer. The
    resulting 2D image is then composited with the rest of the Qt Quick scene.

    \note While QQuickRhiItem is a public Qt API, the QRhi family of classes in
    the Qt Gui module, including QShader and QShaderDescription, offer limited
    compatibility guarantees. There are no source or binary compatibility
    guarantees for these classes, meaning the API is only guaranteed to work
    with the Qt version the application was developed against. Source
    incompatible changes are however aimed to be kept at a minimum and will
    only be made in minor releases (6.7, 6.8, and so on). \c{qquickrhiitem.h}
    does not directly include any QRhi-related headers. To use those classes
    when implementing a QQuickRhiItem subclass, link to
    \c{Qt::GuiPrivate} (if using CMake), and include the appropriate headers
    with the \c rhi prefix, for example \c{#include <rhi/qrhi.h>}.

    QQuickRhiItem is a replacement for the legacy \l QQuickFramebufferObject
    class. The latter is inherently tied to OpenGL / OpenGL ES, whereas
    QQuickRhiItem works with the QRhi classes, allowing to run the same
    rendering code with Vulkan, Metal, Direct 3D 11/12, and OpenGL / OpenGL ES.
    Conceptually and functionally they are very close, and migrating from
    QQuickFramebufferObject to QQuickRhiItem is straightforward.
    QQuickFramebufferObject continues to be available to ensure compatibility
    for existing application code that works directly with the OpenGL API.

    \note QQuickRhiItem will not be functional when using the \c software
    adaptation of the Qt Quick scene graph.

    On most platforms, the scene graph rendering, and thus the rendering
    performed by the QQuickRhiItem will occur on a \l {Scene Graph and
    Rendering}{dedicated thread}. For this reason, the QQuickRhiItem class
    enforces a strict separation between the item implementation (the
    QQuickItem subclass) and the actual rendering logic. All item logic, such
    as properties and UI-related helper functions exposed to QML must be
    located in the QQuickRhiItem subclass. Everything that relates to rendering
    must be located in the QQuickRhiItemRenderer class. To avoid race
    conditions and read/write issues from two threads it is important that the
    renderer and the item never read or write shared variables. Communication
    between the item and the renderer should primarily happen via the
    QQuickRhiItem::synchronize() function. This function will be called on the
    render thread while the GUI thread is blocked. Using queued connections or
    events for communication between item and renderer is also possible.

    Applications must subclass both QQuickRhiItem and QQuickRhiItemRenderer.
    The pure virtual createRenderer() function must be reimplemented to return
    a new instance of the QQuickRhiItemRenderer subclass.

    As with QRhiWidget, QQuickRhiItem automatically managed the color buffer,
    which is a 2D texture (QRhiTexture) normally, or a QRhiRenderBuffer when
    multisampling is in use. (some 3D APIs differentiate between textures and
    renderbuffers, while with some others the underlying native resource is the
    same; renderbuffers are used mainly to allow multisampling with OpenGL ES
    3.0)

    The size of the texture will by default adapt to the size of the item (with
    the \l{QQuickWindow::effectiveDevicePixelRatio()}{device pixel ratio} taken
    into account). If the item size changes, the texture is recreated with the
    correct size. If a fixed size is preferred, set \l fixedColorBufferWidth and
    \l fixedColorBufferHeight to non-zero values.

    QQuickRhiItem is a \l{QSGTextureProvider}{texture provider} and can be used
    directly in \l {ShaderEffect}{ShaderEffects} and other classes that consume
    texture providers.

    While not a primary use case, QQuickRhiItem also allows incorporating
    rendering code that directly uses a 3D graphics API such as Vulkan, Metal,
    Direct 3D, or OpenGL. See \l QRhiCommandBuffer::beginExternal() for details
    on recording native commands within a QRhi render pass, as well as
    \l QRhiTexture::createFrom() for a way to wrap an existing native texture and
    then use it with QRhi in a subsequent render pass. See also
    \l QQuickGraphicsConfiguration regarding configuring the native 3D API
    environment (e.g. device extensions) and note that the \l QQuickWindow can be
    associated with a custom \l QVulkanInstance by calling
    \l QWindow::setVulkanInstance() early enough.

    \note QQuickRhiItem always uses the same QRhi instance the QQuickWindow
    uses (and by extension, the same OpenGL context, Vulkan device, etc.). To
    choose which underlying 3D graphics API is used, call
    \l{QQuickWindow::setGraphicsApi()}{setGraphicsApi()} on the QQuickWindow
    early enough. Changing it is not possible once the scene graph has
    initialized, and all QQuickRhiItem instances in the scene will render using
    the same 3D API.

    \section2 A simple example

    Take the following subclass of QQuickRhiItem. It is shown here in complete
    form. It renders a single triangle with a perspective projection, where the
    triangle is rotated based on the \c angle property of the custom item.
    (meaning it can be driven for example with animations such as
    \l NumberAnimation from QML)

    \snippet qquickrhiitem/qquickrhiitem_intro.cpp 0

    It is notable that this simple class is almost exactly the same as the code
    shown in the \l QRhiWidget introduction. The vertex and fragment shaders are
    the same as well. These are provided as Vulkan-style GLSL source code and
    must be processed first by the Qt shader infrastructure first. This is
    achieved either by running the \c qsb command-line tool manually, or by
    using the \l{Qt Shader Tools Build System Integration}{qt_add_shaders()}
    function in CMake. The QQuickRhiItem loads these pre-processed \c{.qsb}
    files that are shipped with the application. See \l{Qt Shader Tools} for
    more information about Qt's shader translation infrastructure.

    \c{color.vert}

    \snippet qquickrhiitem/qquickrhiitem_intro.vert 0

    \c{color.frag}

    \snippet qquickrhiitem/qquickrhiitem_intro.frag 0

    Once exposed to QML (note the \c QML_NAMED_ELEMENT), our custom item can be
    instantiated in any scene. (after importing the appropriate \c URI specified
    for \l{qt6_add_qml_module}{qt_add_qml_module} in the CMake project)

    \code
    ExampleRhiItem {
        anchors.fill: parent
        anchors.margins: 10
        NumberAnimation on angle { from: 0; to: 360; duration: 5000; loops: Animation.Infinite }
    }
    \endcode

    See \l{Scene Graph - RHI Texture Item} for a more complex example.

    \property QQuickRhiItem::sampleCount

    This property controls for sample count for multisample antialiasing.
    By default the value is \c 1 which means MSAA is disabled.

    Valid values are 1, 4, 8, and sometimes 16 and 32.
    \l QRhi::supportedSampleCounts() can be used to query the supported sample
    counts at run time, but typically applications should request 1 (no MSAA),
    4x (normal MSAA) or 8x (high MSAA).

    \note Setting a new value implies that all QRhiGraphicsPipeline objects
    created by the renderer must use the same sample count from then on.
    Existing QRhiGraphicsPipeline objects created with a different sample count
    must not be used anymore. When the value changes, all color and
    depth-stencil buffers are destroyed and recreated automatically, and
    \l {QQuickRhiItemRenderer::}{initialize()} is invoked again. However, when
    isAutoRenderTargetEnabled() is \c false, it will be up to the application to
    manage this with regards to the depth-stencil buffer or additional color
    buffers.

    Changing the sample count from the default 1 to a higher value implies that
    \l {QQuickRhiItemRenderer::}{colorTexture()} becomes \nullptr and
    \l {QQuickRhiItemRenderer::}{msaaColorBuffer()} starts returning a
    valid object. Switching back to 1 (or 0), implies the opposite: in the next
    call to initialize() msaaColorBuffer() is going to return \nullptr, whereas
    colorTexture() becomes once again valid. In addition,
    \l {QQuickRhiItemRenderer::}{resolveTexture()}
    returns a valid (non-multisample) QRhiTexture whenever the sample count is
    greater than 1 (i.e., MSAA is in use).

    QRhi or texture change for any reason. The function is expected to
    maintain (create if not yet created, adjust and rebuild if the size has
    changed) the graphics resources used by the rendering code in render().

    To query the QRhi, QRhiTexture, and other related objects, call rhi(),
    colorTexture(), depthStencilBuffer(), and renderTarget().

    When the item size changes, the QRhi object, the color buffer texture,
    and the depth stencil buffer objects are all the same instances (so the
    getters return the same pointers) as before, but the color and
    depth/stencil buffers will likely have been rebuilt, meaning the
    \l{QRhiTexture::pixelSize()}{size} and the underlying native texture
    resource may be different than in the last invocation.

    Reimplementations should also be prepared that the QRhi object and the
    color buffer texture may change between invocations of this function. For
    example, when the item is reparented so that it belongs to a new
    QQuickWindow, the the QRhi and all related resources managed by the
    QQuickRhiItem will be different instances than before in the subsequent
    call to this function. Is is then important that all existing QRhi
    resources previously created by the subclass are destroyed because they
    belong to the previous QRhi that should not be used anymore.

    default, a depth-stencil QRhiRenderBuffer and a QRhiTextureRenderTarget
    associated with the colorTexture() (or msaaColorBuffer()) and the
    depth-stencil buffer are created and managed automatically.
    Reimplementations of initialize() and render() can query those objects via
    depthStencilBuffer() and renderTarget(). When
    \l {QQuickRhiItem::}{autoRenderTarget} is set to \c false, these objects are
    no longer created and managed automatically. Rather, it will be

    depth-stencil attachments for the render target, their size and sample
    count must always follow the size and sample count of colorTexture() (or
    msaaColorBuffer()), otherwise rendering or 3D API validation errors may
    occur.
