\class QQmlIncubationController
\brief QQmlIncubationController instances drive the progress of QQmlIncubators.
\inmodule QtQml

In order to behave asynchronously and not introduce stutters or freezes in an application,
the process of creating objects a QQmlIncubators must be driven only during the
application's idle time.  QQmlIncubationController allows the application to control
exactly when, how often and for how long this processing occurs.

A QQmlIncubationController derived instance should be created and set on a
QQmlEngine by calling the QQmlEngine::setIncubationController() method.
Processing is then controlled by calling the QQmlIncubationController::incubateFor()
or QQmlIncubationController::incubateWhile() methods as dictated by the application's
requirements.

For example, this is an example of a incubation controller that will incubate for a maximum
of 5 milliseconds out of every 16 milliseconds.

\code
class PeriodicIncubationController : public QObject,
                                     public QQmlIncubationController
{
public:
    PeriodicIncubationController() {
        startTimer(16);
    }

protected:
    void timerEvent(QTimerEvent *) override {
        incubateFor(5);
    }
};
\endcode

Although the previous example would work, it is not optimal.  Real world incubation
controllers should try and maximize the amount of idle time they consume - rather
than a static amount like 5 milliseconds - while not disturbing the application.

\class QQmlIncubator
\brief The QQmlIncubator class allows QML objects to be created asynchronously.
\inmodule QtQml

Creating QML objects - like delegates in a view, or a new page in an application - can take
a noticeable amount of time, especially on resource constrained mobile devices.  When an
application uses QQmlComponent::create() directly, the QML object instance is created
synchronously which, depending on the complexity of the object,  can cause noticeable pauses or
stutters in the application.

The use of QQmlIncubator gives more control over the creation of a QML object,
including allowing it to be created asynchronously using application idle time.  The following
example shows a simple use of QQmlIncubator.

\code
QQmlIncubator incubator;
component->create(incubator);

while (!incubator.isReady()) {
    QCoreApplication::processEvents(QEventLoop::AllEvents, 50);
}

QObject *object = incubator.object();
\endcode

Asynchronous incubators are controlled by a QQmlIncubationController that is
set on the QQmlEngine, which lets the engine know when the application is idle and
incubating objects should be processed.  If an incubation controller is not set on the
QQmlEngine, QQmlIncubator creates objects synchronously regardless of the
specified IncubationMode.

QQmlIncubator supports three incubation modes:
\list
\li Synchronous The creation occurs synchronously.  That is, once the
QQmlComponent::create() call returns, the incubator will already be in either the
Error or Ready state.  A synchronous incubator has no real advantage compared to using
the synchronous creation methods on QQmlComponent directly, but it may simplify an
application's implementation to use the same API for both synchronous and asynchronous
creations.

\li Asynchronous (default) The creation occurs asynchronously, assuming a
QQmlIncubatorController is set on the QQmlEngine.

The incubator will remain in the Loading state until either the creation is complete or an error
occurs.  The statusChanged() callback can be used to be notified of status changes.

Applications should use the Asynchronous incubation mode to create objects that are not needed
immediately.  For example, the ListView type uses Asynchronous incubation to create objects
that are slightly off screen while the list is being scrolled.  If, during asynchronous creation,
the object is needed immediately the QQmlIncubator::forceCompletion() method can be called
to complete the creation process synchronously.

\li AsynchronousIfNested The creation will occur asynchronously if part of a nested asynchronous
creation, or synchronously if not.

In most scenarios where a QML component wants the appearance of a synchronous
instantiation, it should use this mode.

This mode is best explained with an example.  When the ListView type is first created, it needs
to populate itself with an initial set of delegates to show.  If the ListView was 400 pixels high,
and each delegate was 100 pixels high, it would need to create four initial delegate instances.  If
the ListView used the Asynchronous incubation mode, the ListView would always be created empty and
then, sometime later, the four initial items would appear.

Conversely, if the ListView was to use the Synchronous incubation mode it would behave correctly
but it may introduce stutters into the application.  As QML would have to stop and instantiate the
ListView's delegates synchronously, if the ListView was part of a QML component that was being
instantiated asynchronously this would undo much of the benefit of asynchronous instantiation.

The AsynchronousIfNested mode reconciles this problem.  By using AsynchronousIfNested, the ListView
delegates are instantiated asynchronously if the ListView itself is already part of an asynchronous
instantiation, and synchronously otherwise.  In the case of a nested asynchronous instantiation, the
outer asynchronous instantiation will not complete until after all the nested instantiations have also
completed.  This ensures that by the time the outer asynchronous instantitation completes, inner
items like ListView have already completed loading their initial delegates.

It is almost always incorrect to use the Synchronous incubation mode - elements or components that
want the appearance of synchronous instantiation, but without the downsides of introducing freezes
or stutters into the application, should use the AsynchronousIfNested incubation mode.
