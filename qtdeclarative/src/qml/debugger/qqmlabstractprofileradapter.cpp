 * \class QQmlAbstractProfilerAdapter
 * \inmodule QtQml
 * Abstract base class for all adapters between profilers and the QQmlProfilerService. Adapters have
 * to retrieve profiler-specific data and convert it to the format sent over the wire. Adapters must
 * live in the QDebugServer thread but the actual profilers can live in different threads. The
 * recommended way to deal with this is passing the profiling data through a signal/slot connection.
 */

/*!
 * \internal
 * \fn void QQmlAbstractProfilerAdapter::dataRequested()
 * Signals that data has been requested by the \c QQmlProfilerService. This signal should be
 * connected to a slot in the profiler and the profiler should then transfer its currently available
 * profiling data to the adapter as soon as possible.
 */

/*!
 * \internal
 * \fn qint64 QQmlAbstractProfilerAdapter::sendMessages(qint64 until, QList<QByteArray> &messages)
 * Append the messages up to the timestamp \a until, chronologically sorted, to \a messages. Keep
 * track of the messages already sent and with each subsequent call to this method start with the
 * first one not yet sent. Messages that have been sent can be deleted. When new data from the
 * profiler arrives the information about the last sent message must be reset. Return the timestamp
 * of the next message after \a until or \c -1 if there is no such message.
 * The profiler service keeps a list of adapters, sorted by time of next message and keeps querying
 * the first one to send messages up to the time of the second one. Like that we get chronologically
 * sorted messages and can occasionally post the messages to exploit parallelism and save memory.
