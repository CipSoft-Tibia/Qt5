\title Qt QML QML Types
\ingroup qmlmodules
\brief List of QML types provided by the Qt QML module

The \l{Qt QML} module provides the definition and implementation of various
convenience types which can be used with the QML language, including some
elementary QML types which can provide the basis for further extensions to the
QML language. The \l QtObject and \l Component object types are non-visual and
provide building-blocks for extensions to QML.

\section1 Importing QtQml

The types provided by the \c QtQml module are only available in a QML document
if that document imports the \c QtQml namespace (or if the document imports the
\c QtQuick namespace, as noted below).

The current version of the \c QtQml module is version 2.\QtMinorVersion, and
thus it may be imported via the following statement:

\qml \QtMinorVersion
import QtQml 2.\1
\endqml

Most clients will never need to use the \c QtQml import, as all of the types
are also provided by the \c QtQuick namespace which may be imported as
follows:

\qml \QtMinorVersion
import QtQuick 2.\1
\endqml

See the \l{Qt Quick} module documentation for more information about the \c
QtQuick namespace and what it provides to QML application developers.

The QML types for creating lists and models, such as \l ListModel and \l
ListElement, are moved to a submodule, \c QtQml.Models. The \l{Qt QML Models QML
Types}{Qt QML Models} page has more information.


The documentation for the types below applies equally to the types of the same
name provided by the \l{Qt Quick} module, as they are in fact identical.

\section1 Basic Types

The following \l{qtqml-typesystem-basictypes.html}{QML basic types} are
provided:

\annotatedlist qtqmlbasictypes

\section1 Object Types

The following \l{qtqml-typesystem-objecttypes.html}{QML object types} are
provided:

/*!
\qmlbasictype date
\ingroup qtqmlbasictypes
\ingroup qtquickbasictypes
\brief a date value.

The \c date type refers to a date value, including the time of the day.

To create a \c date value, specify it as a "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.zzzZ" string.
(The T is literal, YYYY is a full year number, MM and DD are month and day
numbers, hh, mm and ss are hours, minutes and seconds, with .zzz as
milliseconds and Z as time-zone offset. The T and following time are optional.
If they are omitted, the date is handled as the start of UTC's day, which
falls on other dates in some time-zones. When T is included, the :ss.zzz or
just .zzz part can be omitted. With or without those, the zone offset can be
omitted, in which case local time is used.)  For example:

\qml
MyDatePicker { minDate: "2000-01-01 0:0"; maxDate: "2020-12-31 23:59" }
\endqml

To read a date value returned from a C++ extension class, use
\l{QtQml::Qt::formatDate()}{Qt.formatDate()} and \l{QtQml::Qt::formatDateTime()}{Qt.formatDateTime()}.

When integrating with C++, note that any QDate or QDateTime value
\l{qtqml-cppintegration-data.html}{passed into QML from C++} is automatically
converted into a \c date value, and vice-versa. Note, however, that
converting a QDate will result in UTC's start of the day, which falls on
a different date in some other time-zones. It is usually more robust
to convert the QDate via a QDateTime explicitly, specifying local-time
or a relevant time-zone and selecting a time of day (such as noon)
that reliably exists (daylight-savings transitions skip an hour, near
one end or the other of a day).

This basic type is provided by the QML language. It can be implicitly converted
to a \l{QtQml::Date}{Date} object.

/*!
\qmlbasictype point
\ingroup qtqmlbasictypes
\ingroup qtquickbasictypes
\brief a value with x and y attributes.

The \c point type refers to a value with \c x and \c y attributes.

To create a \c point value, specify it as a "x,y" string:

\qml
CustomObject { myPointProperty: "0,20" }
\endqml

Or use the \l{QtQml::Qt::point()}{Qt.point()} function:

\qml
CustomObject { myPointProperty: Qt.point(0, 20) }
\endqml

When integrating with C++, note that any QPoint or QPointF value
\l{qtqml-cppintegration-data.html}{passed into QML from C++} is automatically
converted into a \c point value. When a \c point value is passed to C++, it
is automatically converted into a QPointF value.

/*!
\qmlbasictype size
\ingroup qtqmlbasictypes
\ingroup qtquickbasictypes
\brief a value with width and height attributes

The \c size type refers to a value with has \c width and \c height attributes.

For example, to read the \c width and \c height values of the
\l {Image::sourceSize} size-type property:

\qml
Column {
    Image { id: image; source: "logo.png" }
    Text { text: image.sourceSize.width + "," + image.sourceSize.height }
}
\endqml

To create a \c size value, specify it as a "width x height" string:

\qml
Image { sourceSize: "150x50" }
\endqml

Or use the \l{QtQml::Qt::size()}{Qt.size()} function:

\qml
Image { sourceSize: Qt.size(150, 50) }
\endqml

When integrating with C++, note that any QSize or QSizeF value
\l{qtqml-cppintegration-data.html}{passed into QML from C++} is automatically
converted into a \c size value, and vice-versa. When a \c size value is passed to C++, it
is automatically converted into a QSizeF value.

/*!
\qmlbasictype rect
\ingroup qtqmlbasictypes
\ingroup qtquickbasictypes
\brief a value with x, y, width and height attributes.

The \c rect type refers to a value with \c x, \c y, \c width and \c height attributes.

For example, to read the \c width and \c height values of the \l Item
\l {Item::childrenRect.x}{childrenRect} rect-type property:

\qml
Rectangle {
    width: childrenRect.width
    height: childrenRect.height

    Rectangle { width: 100; height: 100 }
}
\endqml

To create a \c rect value, specify it as a "x, y, width x height" string:

\qml
CustomObject { myRectProperty: "50,50,100x100" }
\endqml

Or use the \l{QtQml::Qt::rect()}{Qt.rect()} function:

\qml
CustomObject { myRectProperty: Qt.rect(50, 50, 100, 100) }
\endqml

The \c rect type also exposes read-only \c left, \c right, \c top and \c bottom
attributes. These are the same as their \l {QRectF}{C++ counterparts}.

When integrating with C++, note that any QRect or QRectF value
\l{qtqml-cppintegration-data.html}{passed into QML from C++} is automatically
converted into a \c rect value, and vice-versa. When a \c rect value is passed to C++, it
is automatically converted into a QRectF value.
