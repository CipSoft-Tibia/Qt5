\title Integrating QML and JavaScript
\brief Description of how to use JavaScript in QML applications

The QML language uses a JSON-like syntax and allows various expressions and
methods to be defined as JavaScript functions.  It also allows users to import
JavaScript files and use the functionality those imports provide.

This allows developers and designers to leverage the knowledge they have of
JavaScript to quickly develop both user-interfaces and application logic.

\section1 JavaScript Expressions

QML has a deep JavaScript integration, and allows \l{Signal Attributes}
{signal handlers} and \l{Method Attributes}{methods} to be defined in JavaScript.
Another core feature of QML is the ability to specify and enforce relationships
between object properties using \l{Property Binding}{property bindings}, which
are also defined using JavaScript.

See the documentation page titled
\l{qtqml-javascript-expressions.html}{JavaScript Expressions in QML Documents}
for more information about using JavaScript expressions in QML.

\section1 JavaScript Resources

Application logic defined in JavaScript functions may be separated into
separate JavaScript files known as JavaScript resources.  There are several
different kinds of JavaScript resources, with different semantics.

See the documentation page titled \l{qtqml-javascript-resources.html}
{Defining JavaScript Resources In QML} for more information about defining JavaScript
resources for QML.

\section1 JavaScript Imports

A QML document may import JavaScript resources, and JavaScript resources may
import other JavaScript resources as well as QML modules.  This allows an
application developer to provide application logic in modular, self-contained
files.

See the documentation page titled
\l{qtqml-javascript-imports.html}{Importing JavaScript Resources}
for more information on how to import JavaScript resources and how to use the
functionality they provide.

\section1 JavaScript Host Environment

The QML engine provides a JavaScript environment that has some differences to
the JavaScript environment provided by a web browser.  Certain limitations
apply to code running in the environment, and the QML engine provides various
objects in the root context which may be unfamiliar to JavaScript developers.

These limitations and extensions are documented in the description of the
\l{qtqml-javascript-hostenvironment.html}{JavaScript Host Environment} provided
by the QML engine.

\section1 Fine Tuning the JavaScript engine

For specific use cases you may want to override some of the parameters the
JavaScript engine uses for handling memory and compiling JavaScript. See
\l{qtqml-javascript-finetuning.html}{Fine Tuning the JavaScript engine} for
more information on these parameters.
