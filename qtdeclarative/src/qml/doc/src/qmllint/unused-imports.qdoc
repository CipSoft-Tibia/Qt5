\title Unused imports
\brief Types of the imported module were not used.

\qmllintwarningcategory unused-imports

\section1 Unused import

\section2 What happened?
You used an \l{qtqml-syntax-imports.html}{import statement} to import a QML module,
but did not use any of its types.

\section2 Why is this bad?
The import statement states a dependency to a QML module which is actually not needed.
This affects the readability of the code and the performance of the
QML engine and tooling by making them process an unnecessary QML module.

\section2 Example
\qml
import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Controls

Item {}

\endqml
To fix this warning, remove the unused import:
\qml
import QtQuick

Item {}

\endqml
