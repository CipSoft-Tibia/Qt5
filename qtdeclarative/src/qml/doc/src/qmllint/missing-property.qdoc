\title Missing property
\brief Binding a value to a non-existing property.

\qmllintwarningcategory missing-property

\section1 Can't assign to non-existent default property

\section2 What happened?
You assigned an object to a non-existing default property.

\section2 Why is this bad?
The QML engine can't assign this object at runtime.

\section2 Example
\qml
import QtQuick

Item {
    component MyType: QtObject { property Item myItem; }

    MyType {
        Item {}
    }
}

\endqml
To fix this warning, specify the property you want to bind to or, if you are the author
of the type, mark a property as default:
\qml
import QtQuick

Item {
    component MyType: QtObject { property Item myItem; }

    MyType {
        myItem: Item {}
    }

    component AlternativeMyType: QtObject { default property Item myItem; }

    AlternativeMyType {
        Item {} // bound to myItem via default property
    }
}
\endqml

\section1 Property does not exist

\section2 What happened?
You assigned an expression to a non-existing property.

\section2 Why is this bad?
The QML engine can't assign this expression at runtime.

\section2 Example
\qml
import QtQuick

Item {
    property int myInt
    myItn: 42
}

\endqml
To fix this warning, remove the binding or correct a possible typo:
\qml
import QtQuick

Item {
    property int myInt
    myInt: 42
}

\endqml

\section1 Member not found on type

\section2 What happened?
You accessed a member in a field member expression that can't be found by QML tooling.

A field member expression is an expression of the form \c {someId.someProperty}.

\section2 Why is this bad?
The QML tooling can't find this member, and the QML engine probably can't either.

\section2 Example
\qml
import QtQuick

Item {
    id: self
    property int myInt
    property int myInt2: 1 + self.myItn
}

\endqml
To fix this warning, remove the binding or correct a possible typo:
\qml
import QtQuick

Item {
    id: self
    property int myInt
    property int myInt2: 1 + self.myInt
}

\endqml
