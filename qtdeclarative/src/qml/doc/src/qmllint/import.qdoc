\title Warnings occurred while importing
\brief The imported module was not found.

\qmllintwarningcategory import

\section1 Failed to import module

\section2 What happened?
The module imported via \l{Import Statements}{import statement} was not found.

This can be caused, for example, by
\list
    \li a typo in the import statement, or
    \li a user-defined module that was not built, or
    \li a wrong \l{Import Statements#qml-import-path}{import path}, or
    \li a missing module
\endlist

\section2 Why is this bad?
The application can't run because it can't find a module it relies on.

\section2 Examples

\section3 Typo In The Import Statement
\qml
import QtQuicky // not ok: typo in module name

Item {
}
\endqml
To fix this warning, correct the typo:
\qml
import QtQuick // ok: no typo in module name

Item {
}
\endqml

\section3 User-defined module that was not built

Some tooling like \l{\QMLLS Reference}{\QMLLS} or \l{qmllint Reference}{qmllint}
can't find user-defined modules when they
are not built. If your project defines the QML Module you are trying to import, then
the QML tooling will not find it until you build it.

\note If building the module does not help when using \l{\QMLLS Reference}{\QMLLS}, follow the
instructions in
\l{Setting up the QML Language Server in Your Editor}{\QMLLS setup instructions}
and make sure that you communicate the correct build folder to \QMLLS.

\section3 Wrong import path

Please refer to \l{Import Statements#qml-import-path}{the QML import path documentation} and to
\l{Debugging QML Applications#debugging-module-imports}{the debugging module import documentation}
for more information about import paths.

\section3 Missing module

If the previous sections did not help to find the imported module, it might be missing.
This might be caused by a missing dependency. When using external libraries, verify that they are
actually installed, and that their modules end up in an
\l{Import Statements#qml-import-path}{import path}.

\section1 Component was not found

\section2 What happened?
Some component was not found.

\section2 Why is this bad?
The application can't run because it can't instantiate the non-found component.

\section2 Examples

\section3 Typo in the component name
\qml
import QtQuick

Item {
    Itemy {} // not ok: typo in name
}
\endqml
To fix this warning, correct the typo:
\qml
import QtQuick

Item {
    Item {} // ok: no typo in name
}
\endqml

\section3 Missing import statement

\qml

Item { // not ok: must be imported from QtQuick first
}
\endqml
To fix this warning, add the missing module import:
\qml
import QtQuick

Item { // ok: was imported from QtQuick
}
\endqml

\section1 Import qualifier must start with a capital letter

\section2 What happened?
Some imported module has an invalid qualifier.

\section2 Why is this bad?
The module imported with this invalid qualifier can't be used.

\section2 Examples

\qml
import QtQuick as qq

qq.Item {
}
\endqml
To fix this warning, make the import qualifier start with an upper case letter:
\qml
import QtQuick as Qq

Qq.Item {
}
\endqml

\section1 Unknown import syntax

\section2 What happened?
An import statement is using an invalid \l{Import Statements}{import syntax}.

\section2 Why is this bad?
The application can't run because it can't import a module it relies on.

\section2 Examples

\qml
import "¯\(ツ)/¯:/path/to/Module"
import QtQuick

Item {
}
\endqml
To fix this warning, use URLs that have an allowed scheme:
\qml
import "qrc:/path/to/Module"
import QtQuick

Item {
}
\endqml

\note This example assumes that you are not using \l{QQmlAbstractUrlInterceptor}{URL handlers}.
