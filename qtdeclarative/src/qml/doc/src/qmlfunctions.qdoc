  \macro QML_ELEMENT
  \relates QQmlEngine

  Declares the enclosing type or namespace to be available in QML, using its
  class or namespace name as the QML element name.

  For example, this makes the C++ class \c Slider available as a QML type
  named \c Slider.

  \code
  class Slider : public QObject
  {
      Q_OBJECT
      QML_ELEMENT
      ...
  }
  \endcode

  You can use the build system to register the type in the type namespace
  \e {com.mycompany.qmlcomponents} with major version \c 1 by specifying the
  following in your project file:

  \badcode
  CONFIG += qmltypes
  QML_IMPORT_NAME = com.mycompany.qmlcomponents
  QML_IMPORT_MAJOR_VERSION = 1
  \endcode

  Once registered, the type can be used in QML by importing the
  same type namespace and version number:

  \qml
  import com.mycompany.qmlcomponents 1.0

  Slider {
      // ...
  }
  \endqml

  You can also make namespaces tagged with Q_NAMESPACE available this way, in
  order to expose any enums tagged with Q_ENUM_NS they contain.

  Declares the enclosing type or namespace to be available in QML, using \a name
  as the element name. Otherwise behaves the same as QML_ELEMENT.

  \code
  class SqlEventDatabase : public QObject
  {
      Q_OBJECT

  Declares the enclosing type to be available, but anonymous in QML. The type
  cannot be created or used as property type, but when passed from C++, it is
  recognized.

  \sa QML_ELEMENT, QML_NAMED_ELEMENT(), QML_UNCREATABLE(), QML_INTERFACE
*/

/*!
  \macro QML_INTERFACE
  \relates QQmlEngine

  This macro registers the enclosing C++ type in the QML system as an interface.

  Types registered as an interface in QML should also declare themselves as an
  interface with the \l {The Meta-Object System}{meta object system}. For
  example:

  \code
  struct FooInterface
  {
      QML_INTERFACE
  public:
      virtual ~FooInterface();
      virtual void doSomething() = 0;
  };

  Q_DECLARE_INTERFACE(FooInterface, "org.foo.FooInterface")
  \endcode

  When registered with QML in this way, they can be used as property types:

  Q_PROPERTY(FooInterface *foo READ foo WRITE setFoo)

  When you assign a \l QObject sub-class to this property, the QML engine does
  the interface cast to \c FooInterface* automatically.

  Interface types are implicitly anonymous and uncreatable in QML.

/*!
  \macro QML_UNCREATABLE(reason)

  Declares that the enclosing type shall not be creatable from QML. This takes
  effect if the type is available in QML, by having a \l QML_ELEMENT or
  \l QML_NAMED_ELEMENT() macro. The \a reason will be emitted as error message if an
  attempt to create the type from QML is detected.

  Some QML types are implicitly uncreatable, in particular types exposed with
  \l QML_ANONYMOUS or namespaces exposed with \l QML_ELEMENT or
  \l QML_NAMED_ELEMENT(). For such types, \l QML_UNCREATABLE() can be used to
  provide a custom error message.

  Declares the enclosing type to be a singleton in QML. This only takes effect
  if the type is a \l Q_OBJECT and is available in QML (by having a
  \l QML_ELEMENT or \l QML_NAMED_ELEMENT() macro). By default, each QQmlEngine
  will try to create a singleton instance using the type's default constructor
  when the type is first accessed. If there is no default constructor the
  singleton is initially inaccessible. This behavior can be overridden by calling
  \l qmlRegisterSingletonType() with a specific factory function or
  \l qmlRegisterSingletonInstance() with a specific instance for the same class
  and the same type namespace and version.

  \sa QML_ELEMENT, QML_NAMED_ELEMENT(), qmlRegisterSingletonInstance().
*/

/*!
  \macro QML_ADDED_IN_MINOR_VERSION(VERSION)
  \relates QQmlEngine

  Declares that the enclosing type or namespace was added in the specified minor
  \a VERSION, relative to the module major version. The minor version is assumed
  to be in line with any revisions given by \l Q_REVISION() macros on methods,
  slots, or signals, and any REVISION tags on properties declared with
  \l Q_PROPERTY().

  \l QML_ADDED_IN_MINOR_VERSION() only takes effect if the type or namespace is
  available in QML, by having a \l QML_ELEMENT, \l QML_NAMED_ELEMENT(),
  \l QML_ANONYMOUS, or \l QML_INTERFACE macro.

  If the QML module the type belongs to is imported with a lower version than
  the one determined this way, the QML type is invisible.

  \sa QML_ELEMENT, QML_NAMED_ELEMENT()
*/

/*!
  \macro QML_REMOVED_IN_MINOR_VERSION(VERSION)
  \relates QQmlEngine

  Declares that the enclosing type or namespace was removed in the specified
  minor \a VERSION, relative to the module major version. This is primarily
  useful when replacing the implementation of a QML type. If a corresponding
  \l QML_ADDED_IN_MINOR_VERSION() is present on a different type or namespace of
  the same QML name, then the removed type is used when importing versions of
  the module lower than \a VERSION, and the added type is used when importing
  versions of the module greater or equal \a VERSION.

  \l QML_REMOVED_IN_MINOR_VERSION() only takes effect if type or namespace is
  available in QML, by having a \l QML_ELEMENT, \l QML_NAMED_ELEMENT(),
  \l QML_ANONYMOUS, or \l QML_INTERFACE macro.

/*!
  \macro QML_ATTACHED(ATTACHED_TYPE)
  \relates QQmlEngine

  Declares that the enclosing type attaches \a ATTACHED_TYPE as an
  \l {Attached Properties and Attached Signal Handlers}
  {attached property} to other types. This takes effect if the type
  is exposed to QML using a \l QML_ELEMENT or \l QML_NAMED_ELEMENT() macro.

/*!
  \macro QML_EXTENDED(EXTENDED_TYPE)

  Declares that the enclosing type uses \a EXTENDED_TYPE as an extension to
  provide further properties and methods in QML. This takes effect if the type
  is exposed to QML using a \l QML_ELEMENT or \l QML_NAMED_ELEMENT() macro.

  \sa QML_ELEMENT, QML_NAMED_ELEMENT(), {Registering Extension Objects}
*/

/*!
  \macro QML_FOREIGN(FOREIGN_TYPE)
  \relates QQmlEngine

  Declares that any \l QML_ELEMENT, \l QML_NAMED_ELEMENT(), \l QML_ANONYMOUS,
  \l QML_INTERFACE, \l QML_UNCREATABLE(), \l QML_SINGLETON,
  \l QML_ADDED_IN_MINOR_VERSION(), \l QML_REMOVED_IN_MINOR_VERSION(),
  \l QML_ATTACHED(), or \l QML_EXTENDED() macros in the enclosing C++ type do
  not apply to the enclosing type but instead to \a FOREIGN_TYPE. The enclosing
  type still needs to be registered with the
  \l {The Meta-Object System}{meta object system} using a \l Q_GADGET or
  \l Q_OBJECT macro.

  This is useful for registering types that cannot be amended to add the macros,
  for example because they belong to 3rdparty libraries.

  \b{NOTE:} You may want to use \l QML_NAMED_ELEMENT() instead of \l QML_ELEMENT due to the fact that
  the element will be named like the struct it is contained in, not the foreign type.
  See \l {Extending QML - Extension Objects Example} for an example.

  \sa QML_ELEMENT, QML_NAMED_ELEMENT()
*/

/*!
  \macro QML_UNAVAILABLE
  \relates QQmlEngine

  This macro declares the enclosing type to be unavailable in QML. It registers
  an internal dummy type called \c QQmlTypeNotAvailable as \l QML_FOREIGN()
  type, using any further QML macros you specify.

  Normally, the types exported by a module should be fixed. However, if a C++
  type is not available, you should at least "reserve" the QML type name, and
  give the user of the unavailable type a meaningful error message.

  Example:

  \code
  #ifdef NO_GAMES_ALLOWED
  struct MinehuntGame
  {
      Q_GADGET
      QML_NAMED_ELEMENT(Game)
      QML_UNAVAILABLE
      QML_UNCREATABLE("Get back to work, slacker!");
  };
  #else
  class MinehuntGame : public QObject
  {
      Q_OBJECT
      QML_NAMED_ELEMENT(Game)
      // ...
  };
  #endif
  \endcode

  This will cause any QML which attempts to use the "Game" type to produce an
  error message:

  \badcode
  fun.qml: Get back to work, slacker!
     Game {
     ^
  \endcode

  Using this technique, you only need a \l Q_GADGET struct to customize the error
  message, not a full-blown \l QObject. Without \l QML_UNCREATABLE(),
  \l QML_UNAVAILABLE still results in a more specific error message than the usual
  "is not a type" for completely unknown types.

/*!
  \macro QML_DECLARE_TYPEINFO(Type,Flags)

  Declares additional properties of the given \a Type as described by the

  Current the only supported type info is \c QML_HAS_ATTACHED_PROPERTIES which
  declares that the \a Type supports \l {Attached Properties and Attached Signal Handlers}

/*!
  \fn int qmlRegisterType(const char *uri, int versionMajor, int versionMinor, const char *qmlName)
  \relates QQmlEngine

  This template function registers the C++ type in the QML system with
  the name \a qmlName, in the library imported from \a uri having the
  version number composed from \a versionMajor and \a versionMinor.

  Returns the QML type id.

  There are two forms of this template function:

  \code
  template<typename T>
  int qmlRegisterType(const char *uri, int versionMajor, int versionMinor, const char *qmlName);

  template<typename T, int metaObjectRevision>
  int qmlRegisterType(const char *uri, int versionMajor, int versionMinor, const char *qmlName);
  \endcode

  The former is the standard form which registers the type \e T as a new type.
  The latter allows a particular revision of a class to be registered in
  a specified version (see \l {Type Revisions and Versions}).


  For example, this registers a C++ class \c MySliderItem as a QML type
  named \c Slider for version 1.0 of a type namespace called
  "com.mycompany.qmlcomponents":

  \code
  qmlRegisterType<MySliderItem>("com.mycompany.qmlcomponents", 1, 0, "Slider");
  \endcode

  Once this is registered, the type can be used in QML by importing the
  specified type namespace and version number:

  \qml
  import com.mycompany.qmlcomponents 1.0

  Slider {
      // ...
  }
  \endqml

  Note that it's perfectly reasonable for a library to register types to older versions
  than the actual version of the library. Indeed, it is normal for the new library to allow
  QML written to previous versions to continue to work, even if more advanced versions of
  some of its types are available.

  will produce the given error \a message.

  Normally, the types exported by a plugin should be fixed. However, if a C++ type is not available, you should

/*!
  \fn int qmlRegisterAnonymousType(const char *uri, int versionMajor)
  \relates QQmlEngine

  This template function registers the C++ type in the QML system as an anonymous type. The
  resulting QML type does not have a name. Therefore, instances of this type cannot be created from
  the QML system. You can, however, access instances of the type when they are exposed as properties
  of other types.

  Use this function when the type will not be referenced by name, specifically for C++ types that
  are used on the left-hand side of a property binding. To indicate to which module the type belongs
  use \a uri and \a versionMajor.

  For example, consider the following two classes:

    \code
    class Bar : public QObject
    {
        Q_OBJECT
        Q_PROPERTY(QString baz READ baz WRITE setBaz NOTIFY bazChanged)

    public:
        Bar() {}

        QString baz() const { return mBaz; }

        void setBaz(const QString &baz)
        {

            mBaz = baz;

    signals:
        void bazChanged();

        Bar *bar() { return &mBar; }

    private:
        Bar mBar;
    };

  In QML, we assign a string to the \c baz property of \c bar:

    \code
    Foo {
        bar.baz: "abc"
        Component.onCompleted: print(bar.baz)
    }

  For the QML engine to know that the \c Bar type has a \c baz property,
  we have to make \c Bar known:

    \code
    qmlRegisterType<Foo>("App", 1, 0, "Foo");
    qmlRegisterAnonymousType<Bar>("App", 1);
    \endcode

  As the \c Foo type is instantiated in QML, it must be registered
  with the version of \l qmlRegisterType() that takes an element name.

   \relates QQmlEngine

   This function may be used to register a singleton type provider \a callback in a particular \a uri
   and \a typeName with a version specified in \a versionMajor and \a versionMinor.

   Installing a singleton type allows developers to provide arbitrary functionality
   (methods and properties) to a client without requiring individual instances of the type to
   be instantiated by the client.

   A singleton type may be either a QObject or a QJSValue.
   This function should be used to register a singleton type provider function which returns a QJSValue as a singleton type.

   \b{NOTE:} QJSValue singleton type properties will \b{not} trigger binding re-evaluation if changed.

   Usage:
   \code
   // First, define the singleton type provider function (callback).
   static QJSValue example_qjsvalue_singletontype_provider(QQmlEngine *engine, QJSEngine *scriptEngine)
   {
       Q_UNUSED(engine)

       static int seedValue = 5;
       QJSValue example = scriptEngine->newObject();
       example.setProperty("someProperty", seedValue++);
       return example;
   }

   // Second, register the singleton type provider with QML by calling this function in an initialization function.
   qmlRegisterSingletonType("Qt.example.qjsvalueApi", 1, 0, "MyApi", example_qjsvalue_singletontype_provider);
   \endcode

   Alternatively, you can use a C++11 lambda:

   \code
   qmlRegisterSingletonType("Qt.example.qjsvalueApi", 1, 0, "MyApi", [](QQmlEngine *engine, QJSEngine *scriptEngine) -> QJSValue {
       Q_UNUSED(engine)

       static int seedValue = 5;
       QJSValue example = scriptEngine->newObject();
       example.setProperty("someProperty", seedValue++);
       return example;
   });
   \endcode

   In order to use the registered singleton type in QML, you must import the singleton type.

   \relates QQmlEngine

   This function may be used to register a singleton type provider \a callback in a particular \a uri
   and \a typeName with a version specified in \a versionMajor and \a versionMinor.

   Installing a singleton type into a uri allows developers to provide arbitrary functionality
   (methods and properties) to clients without requiring individual instances ot the type to be
   instantiated by the client.

   A singleton type may be either a QObject or a QJSValue.
   This function should be used to register a singleton type provider function which returns a QObject
   of the given type T as a singleton type.

   A QObject singleton type may be referenced via the type name with which it was registered, and this
   typename may be used as the target in a \l Connections type or otherwise used as any other type id would.
   One exception to this is that a QObject singleton type property may not be aliased.

   \b{NOTE:} A QObject singleton type instance returned from a singleton type provider is owned by
   the QML engine unless the object has explicit QQmlEngine::CppOwnership flag set.

   Usage:
   \code
   // First, define your QObject which provides the functionality.
   class SingletonTypeExample : public QObject
   {
       Q_OBJECT
       Q_PROPERTY (int someProperty READ someProperty WRITE setSomeProperty NOTIFY somePropertyChanged)

   public:
       SingletonTypeExample(QObject* parent = 0)
           : QObject(parent), m_someProperty(0)
       {
       }

       ~SingletonTypeExample() {}

       Q_INVOKABLE int doSomething() { setSomeProperty(5); return m_someProperty; }

       int someProperty() const { return m_someProperty; }
       void setSomeProperty(int val) { m_someProperty = val; emit somePropertyChanged(val); }

   signals:
       void somePropertyChanged(int newValue);

   private:
       int m_someProperty;
   };

   // Second, define the singleton type provider function (callback).
   static QObject *example_qobject_singletontype_provider(QQmlEngine *engine, QJSEngine *scriptEngine)
   {
       Q_UNUSED(engine)
       Q_UNUSED(scriptEngine)

       SingletonTypeExample *example = new SingletonTypeExample();
       return example;
   }

   // Third, register the singleton type provider with QML by calling this function in an initialization function.
   qmlRegisterSingletonType<SingletonTypeExample>("Qt.example.qobjectSingleton", 1, 0, "MyApi", example_qobject_singletontype_provider);
   \endcode

   Alternatively, you can use a C++11 lambda:

   \code
   qmlRegisterSingletonType<SingletonTypeExample>("Qt.example.qobjectSingleton", 1, 0, "MyApi", [](QQmlEngine *engine, QJSEngine *scriptEngine) -> QObject * {
       Q_UNUSED(engine)
       Q_UNUSED(scriptEngine)

       SingletonTypeExample *example = new SingletonTypeExample();
       return example;
   });
   \endcode

   In order to use the registered singleton type in QML, you must import the singleton type.
   \qml
   import QtQuick 2.0
   import Qt.example.qobjectSingleton 1.0
   Item {
       id: root
       property int someValue: MyApi.someProperty

       Component.onCompleted: {
           someValue = MyApi.doSomething()
       }
   }
   \endqml

   \relates QQmlEngine

   This function may be used to register a singleton type with the name \a qmlName, in the library imported from \a uri having
   the version number composed from \a versionMajor and \a versionMinor. The type is defined by the QML file located at \a url.
   The url must be an absolute URL, i.e. url.isRelative() == false.

   In addition the type's QML file must have pragma Singleton statement among its import statements.

   A singleton type may be referenced via the type name with which it was registered, and this typename may be used as the
   target in a \l Connections type or otherwise used as any other type id would. One exception to this is that a singleton
   type property may not be aliased (because the singleton type name does not identify an object within the same component
   as any other item).

   Usage:
   \qml
   // First, define your QML singleton type which provides the functionality.
   pragma Singleton
   import QtQuick 2.0
   Item {
       property int testProp1: 125
   }
   \endqml

   \code
   // Second, register the QML singleton type by calling this function in an initialization function.
   qmlRegisterSingletonType(QUrl("file:///absolute/path/SingletonType.qml"), "Qt.example.qobjectSingleton", 1, 0, "RegisteredSingleton");

   In order to use the registered singleton type in QML, you must import the singleton type.

   Item {

       property int someValue: RegisteredSingleton.testProp1
   }
   \endqml

   It is also possible to have QML singleton types registered without using the qmlRegisterSingletonType function.
   That can be done by adding a pragma Singleton statement among the imports of the type's QML file. In addition
   the type must be defined in a qmldir file with a singleton keyword and the qmldir must be imported by the QML
   files using the singleton.

   \relates QQmlEngine
   \since 5.14

   This function is used to register a singleton object \a cppObject, with a
   particular \a uri and \a typeName. Its version is a combination of \a
   versionMajor and \a versionMinor.

   Installing a singleton type into a URI allows you to provide arbitrary
   functionality (methods and properties) to QML code without requiring
   individual instances of the type to be instantiated by the client.

   Use this function to register an object of the given type T as a singleton
   type.

   A QObject singleton type may be referenced via the type name with which it
   was registered; in turn this type name may be used as the target in a \l
   Connections type, or like any other type ID. However, there's one
   exception: a QObject singleton type property can't be aliased because the
   singleton type name does not identify an object within the same component
   as any other item.

   \note \a cppObject must outlive the QML engine in which it is used.
   Moreover, \cppObject must have the same thread affinity as the engine. If
   you want separate singleton instances for multiple engines, you need to use
   \l {qmlRegisterSingletonType}.  See \l{Threads and QObjects} for more
   information about thread safety.

    Usage:
    \code
    // First, define your QObject which provides the functionality.
    class SingletonTypeExample : public QObject
    {
        Q_OBJECT
        Q_PROPERTY(int someProperty READ someProperty WRITE setSomeProperty NOTIFY somePropertyChanged)

    public:
        explicit SingletonTypeExample(QObject* parent = nullptr) : QObject(parent) {}

        Q_INVOKABLE int doSomething()
        {
            setSomeProperty(5);
            return m_someProperty;
        }

        int someProperty() const { return m_someProperty; }
        void setSomeProperty(int val) {
            if (m_someProperty != val) {
                m_someProperty = val;
                emit somePropertyChanged(val);
            }
        }

    signals:
        void somePropertyChanged(int newValue);

    private:
        int m_someProperty = 0;
    };
    \endcode

    \code
    // Second, create an instance of the object

    // allocate example before the engine to ensure that it outlives it
    QScopedPointer<SingletonTypeExample> example(new SingletonTypeExample);
    QQmlEngine engine;

    // Third, register the singleton type provider with QML by calling this
    // function in an initialization function.
    qmlRegisterSingletonInstance("Qt.example.qobjectSingleton", 1, 0, "MyApi", example.get());
    \endcode


    In order to use the registered singleton type in QML, you must import the
    URI with the corresponding version.
    \qml
    import QtQuick 2.0
    import Qt.example.qobjectSingleton 1.0

  This function registers a type in the QML system with the name \a qmlName, in the library imported from \a uri having the
  version number composed from \a versionMajor and \a versionMinor. The type is defined by the QML file located at \a url. The
  url must be an absolute URL, i.e. url.isRelative() == false.

  Normally QML files can be loaded as types directly from other QML files, or using a qmldir file. This function allows
  registration of files to types from C++ code, such as when the type mapping needs to be procedurally determined at startup.

  Returns -1 if the registration was not successful.

/*!
  \fn bool qmlProtectModule(const char* uri, int majVersion);
  \relates QQmlEngine

  This function protects a module from having types registered into it. This
  can be used to prevent other plugins from injecting types into your module.
  It can also be a performance improvement, as it allows the engine to skip
  checking for the possibility of new types or plugins when this import is
  reached.

  The performance benefit is primarily seen when registering application
  specific types from within the application instead of through a plugin.
  Using qmlProtectModule allows the engine to skip checking for a plugin when
  that uri is imported, which can be noticeable with slow file systems.

  After this function is called, any attempt to register C++ types into this
  uri, major version combination will lead to a runtime error. Call this after
  you have registered all of your types with the engine.

  Returns true if the module with \a uri as a \l{Identified Modules}
  {module identifier} and \a majVersion as a major version number was found
  and locked, otherwise returns false. The module must contain exported types
  in order to be found.

  Returns the QML type id of a type that was registered with the
  name \a qmlName in a particular \a uri and a version specified in \a
  versionMajor and \a versionMinor.

  This function returns the same value as the QML type registration functions
  such as qmlRegisterType() and qmlRegisterSingletonType().

  If \a qmlName, \a uri and \a versionMajor match a registered type, but the
  specified minor version in \a versionMinor is higher, then the id of the type
  with the closest minor version is returned.

  Returns -1 if no matching type was found or one of the given parameters
  was invalid.
