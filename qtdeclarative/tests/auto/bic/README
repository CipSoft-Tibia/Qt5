This directory contains test data to be used by tst_bic to check that we don't
introduce binary incompatible changes between releases. The bic test is run
after every successful integration on Linux only. This data is generated after
each minor release. The generated BC files contain virtual tables, and the bic
test checks new content against the old data.

See the following README for an explanation of how to generate this data:

http://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtqa.git/tree/tests/postbuild/bic/README

The test itself can be found here:
