       a. For each element dn of the BoundNames of d do
          i. If IsConstantDeclaration of d is true, then

          ii. Else,
              2. Perform ! envRec.CreateMutableBinding(dn, false).

       b. If d is a GeneratorDeclaration production or a FunctionDeclaration
          production, then
          i. Let fn be the sole element of the BoundNames of d.
          ii. Let fo be the result of performing InstantiateFunctionObject for
              d with argument env.
          iii. Perform envRec.InitializeBinding(fn, fo).
