Controls
--------

 - Control:
   * [QTBUG-65880] Fixed a bug in deferred execution, that caused the
     background item to not follow the size of the control under certain
     circumstances, leading to a visually missing background.
   * [QTBUG-66133] Fixed focus scope controls, such as Frame, GroupBox,
     Page, and Pane, to respect click and wheel focus policies by clearing
     a potential sub-focus child. This makes it possible to close the virtual
     keyboard by clicking the background of a Pane that has Qt.ClickFocus
     set as its focusPolicy, for example.

 - ComboBox:
  * [QTBUG-65962] Fixed a bug in deferred execution, that caused the popup's
    bindings to not get finalized under certain circumstances, leading to
    a visually missing popup.

 - Popup:
   * [QTBUG-66113] Fixed restoring focus to popups that did not request
     focus when opened, but gained focus later.

Platform
--------

 - Menu:
   * [QTBUG-55251] Fixed opening position on high-DPI screens.

Third-Party Code
