*                        Important Behavior Changes                        *
****************************************************************************

 - [QTBUG-72085] Old delegate items (background, contentItem, etc.) are no
   longer destroyed, as they are technically owned by user code. Instead,
   they are hidden, unparented from the control (QQuickItem parent, not
   QObject), and Accessible.ignored is set to true. This prevents them from
   being unintentionally visible and interfering with the accessibility
   tree when a new delegate item is set.

   See the following page for more information:
