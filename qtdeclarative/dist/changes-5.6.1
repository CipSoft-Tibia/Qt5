****************************************************************************
*                   Important Behavior Changes                             *
****************************************************************************

* [QTBUG-51746] When matching the method signature of a invokable method to
  the slot in the metaobject, the matching function now assigns the best
  match to a QJSValue if the parameter actually is a QJSValue. This corrects
  the previous behavior, where QJSValue and int were given the same match
  score even though QJSValue would have been the best match.
* [QTBUG-50604] Assigning NaN to an Item's x or y previously had the side effect
  of making the item invisible (as well as warning about a bad
  QTransform::translate call). Setting NaN will now be ignored (as it already
  was for width and height), and no longer have any visual effect.
* [QTBUG-51231] TextInput with a non-Normal echoMode can now no longer cut or
  copy text.
