    \title Qt Quick TableViews examples - Pixelator
    \example tableview/pixelator
    \brief The Pixelator example shows how a QML TableView and a delegate
    can be used for custom table models.

    \image qt-pixelator.png
    \ingroup qtquickexamples

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \snippet tableview/pixelator/imagemodel.h model

    We only require a simple, read-only table model. Thus, we need to implement
    functions to indicate the dimensions of the image and supply data to the
    TableView.
    We use the \l{The Property System}{Qt Property System} and a source property
    as \c QString to set the path of the image.
    We also add the QML_ELEMENT macro to expose the model to QML.

    \snippet tableview/pixelator/imagemodel.cpp setsource

    Here we load the image when the source path is set.
    When the source path has changed, we need to call \c beginResetModel() before.
    After the image has been loaded, we need to call \c endResetModel().

    \snippet tableview/pixelator/imagemodel.cpp rowcolcount

    The row and column count is set to image height and width, respectively.

    \snippet tableview/pixelator/imagemodel.cpp data

    This overloaded function allows us to access the pixel data from the image.
    When we call this function with the display role, we return the pixel's
    gray value.

    \snippet tableview/pixelator/main.qml pixelcomponent

    Each pixel in the \c TableView is displayed via a delegate component.
    It contains an item that has an implicit height and width defining the
    cell size of the table.
    It also has a property for the gray value of the pixel that is retrieved
    from the model.

    \snippet tableview/pixelator/main.qml rectshape

    Inside the \c Item, there is a rounded \c Rectangle with the size and
    radius according to the pixel's gray value.

    \snippet tableview/pixelator/main.qml interaction

    For a little bit of interaction, we place a \c MouseArea inside the \c Item
    and change the Rectangle's color on mouse over.

    \snippet tableview/pixelator/main.qml animation

    The \c Rectangle also has a short color animation to fade between the
    colors when it is changed.

    \snippet tableview/pixelator/main.qml tableview

    The \c TableView spans over the whole window and has an instance of our
    custom \c ImageModel attached.
