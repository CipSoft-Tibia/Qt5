    \section1 Tiles

    \e Tiles adds drag and drop to simple rectangles, which you can drag into a
    specific grid.

    It has a DragTile component which uses a MouseArea to move an item when
    dragged:

    \snippet draganddrop/tiles/DragTile.qml 1

    And a DropTile component on which the dragged tiles can be dropped:

    \snippet draganddrop/tiles/DropTile.qml 0

    The keys property of the DropArea will only allow an item to be dropped on it if it
    has a matching key in its Drag.keys property.

    \section1 GridView Example

    The \e {GridView Example} adds drag and drop to a \l GridView, allowing you
    to visually reorder the delegates without changing the underlying
    \l ListModel. It uses a \l DelegateModel to move a delegate item to the
    position of another item it is dragged over.
