    \title Qt Quick Particles Examples - CustomParticle
    \example particles/customparticle
    \brief This is a collection of examples using CustomParticle in the QML particle system.
    \image qml-customparticle-example.png

    This is a collection of small QML examples relating to using CustomParticle in the particle system.
    Each example is a small QML file emphasizing a different way to use CustomParticle.

    Blur Particles adds a blur effect to the particles, which increases over the particle's life time.
    It uses a custom vertex shader:
    \snippet particles/customparticle/content/blurparticles.qml vertex
    to propagate life time simulation to a custom fragment shader:
    \snippet particles/customparticle/content/blurparticles.qml fragment
    which has access to both the normal image sampler and a blurred sampler, the image plus a ShaderEffect.

    Fragment Shader just uses the particle system as a vertex delivery system.
    \snippet particles/customparticle/content/fragmentshader.qml 0

    Image Colors uses CustomParticle to assign colors to particles based on their location in a picture.
    The vertex shader,
    \snippet particles/customparticle/content/imagecolors.qml vertex
    passes along the starting position for each vertex to the fragment shader,
    \snippet particles/customparticle/content/imagecolors.qml fragment
    which uses it to determine the color for that particle.
