QtBluetooth
-----------

 - Fixed a memory leak in QBluetoothServiceDiscoveryAgent on Android.

 - [QTBUG-75035] Improved likelihood of
   QBluetoothSocket::connectToService(QBluetoothServiceInfo,..) succeeding when
   QBluetoothServiceInfo::socketProtocol() returns a non-RFCOMM type. Since Android
   does not support anything but RFCOMM it always assumes RFCOMM.

 - Fixed reading of descriptor values on WinRT.

 - [QTBUG-75043] Fixed behavior when a peripheral changes its service list at runtime

 - [QTBUG-75278] Fixed socket leak when running QLowEnergyController Peripheral mode
   on Linux.
