*                               Qt 5.10.0 Changes                          *
****************************************************************************

QtBluetooth
-----------

 - Register QLowEnergyCharacteristic and QLowEnergyDescriptor as meta
   types. It is therefore necessary to declare them as meta types in the
   header files. This commit will cause conflicts with existing meta type
   declarations in applications using Qt. Those declarations need to be
   removed.

 - Renamed qbluetoothglobal.h to qtbluetoothglobal.h.

 - QBluetoothSocket:
   * Added QBluetoothSocket::RemoteHostClosedError.

 - QLowEnergyController:
   * Added QLowEnergyController::RemoteHostClosedError.

 - Windows:
   * [QTBUG-61566] Enabled UWP backend for desktop Windows versions that
     support the API.

QtNfc
-----

 - Renamed qnfcglobal.h tp qtnfcglobal.h.
