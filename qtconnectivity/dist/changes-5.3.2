Android
-------

 - [QTBUG-39815] Removed calls to Android's BluetoothSocket.isConnected().
   It does not work reliably on all devices and prevented those devices from
   successfully establishing an RFCOMM socket connection.

 - [QTBUG-40172] Increased robustness of QBluetoothSocket::connectToService()
   by providing a fallback implementation using private Android APIs which
   increase the chance of successful connects on some devices.

Linux
-----

 - Removed undesirable system header includes from the Bluez code base.
 - Fixed incomplete SDP entries when using L2CP sockets and avoided
   crash on client side when incomplete SDP entry is encountered.
