 - Added possibility to build win32 backend which also works on Windows 7.

 - Deprecated QBluetoothServiceInfo::DataComplete.

 - Signficant refactoring of the Apple platform Bluetooth code to bring it
   closer to all other code lines. Previously the macOS and iOS code was very
   distinct which caused duplicated code lines.

 - Proved the examples for HighDPI use cases.

 - Added QLowEnergyController::Authorization enum value.

 - [QTBUG-76615] Added the ability to support multiple manufacturer data
   entries per QBluetoothDeviceInfo instance. This is of relevance when dealing
   with BluetoothDeviceDiscoveryAgent::deviceUpdated() signals.

 - [QTBUG77390] Reduced likelyhood of blocking the main event loop on Linux when
   doing a device scan.

 - [BlueZ] [QTBUG-63019] Added QLowEnergyController::createCentral with
   locale device overload.
