\brief Reads and writes NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) messages to NFC Forum Tags.

The NDEF Editor example uses \l{Qt NFC} to read and write NFC Data Exchange Format
(NDEF) messages to NFC Forum Tags. NDEF messages can be composed by
adding text and URI records. Records can be deleted by swiping them to the left.

Press \b {Write to Tag} to write the records to an NFC tag.

Press \b {Read Tag} to read the contents of an NFC tag. A successful read of an
NFC tag replaces the manually added records with the NDEF message from the tag.
If the read operation was cancelled or failed, the NDEF message remains
unchanged.
