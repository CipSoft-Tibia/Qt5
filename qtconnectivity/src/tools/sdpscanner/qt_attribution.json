    "QtUsage": "On Linux, Qt Bluetooth uses a separate executable, sdpscanner,
to integrate with the official Linux Bluetooth protocol stack (BlueZ). The usage is limited
to service discovery via SDP. The Qt Bluetooth library itself does NOT link against BlueZ.
Communication between sdpscanner and QtBluetooth happens via stdin/stdout. Therefore
QtBluetooth and user code linking to it is not considered a derivative work, and does not
have to be released under GPL too.",
