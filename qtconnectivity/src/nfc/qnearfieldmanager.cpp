    \class QNearFieldManager
    \brief The QNearFieldManager class provides access to notifications for NFC events.

    \ingroup connectivity-nfc
    \inmodule QtNfc
    \since 5.2

    NFC Forum devices support two modes of communications.  The first mode, peer-to-peer
    communications, is used to communicate between two NFC Forum devices.  The second mode,
    master/slave communications, is used to communicate between an NFC Forum device and an NFC
    Forum Tag or Contactless Card. The targetDetected() signal is emitted when a target device
    enters communications range. Communications can be initiated from the slot connected to this
    signal.

    NFC Forum devices generally operate as the master in master/slave communications. Some devices
    are also capable of operating as the slave, so called Card Emulation mode. In this mode the
    local NFC device emulates a NFC Forum Tag or Contactless Card.

    Applications can connect to the targetDetected() and targetLost() signals to get notified when
    an NFC Forum Tag enters or leaves proximity. Before these signals are emitted target detection
    must be started with the startTargetDetection() function. Target detection can be stopped with
    the stopTargetDetection() function. When the target is no longer required the target should be
    deleted as other applications may be blocked from accessing the target.
*/

/*!
    \enum QNearFieldManager::AdapterState

    \since 5.12

    This enum describes the different states a NFC adapter can have.

    \value Offline      The nfc adapter is offline.
    \value TurningOn    The nfc adapter is turning on.
    \value Online       The nfc adapter is online.
    \value TurningOff   The nfc adapter is turning off.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QNearFieldManager::adapterStateChanged(AdapterState state)

    \since 5.12

    This signal is emitted whenever the \a state of the NFC adapter changed.

    \note Currently, this signal is only emitted on Android.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QNearFieldManager::targetDetectionStopped()

    \since 6.2

    This signal is emitted whenever the target detection is stopped.

    \note Mostly this signal is emitted when \l stopTargetDetection() has been called.
    Additionally the user is able to stop the detection on iOS within a popup shown
    by the system during the scan, which also leads to emitting this signal.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QNearFieldManager::targetDetected(QNearFieldTarget *target)

    This signal is emitted whenever a target is detected. The \a target parameter represents the
    detected target.

    This signal will be emitted for all detected targets.

    QNearFieldManager maintains ownership of \a target, however, it will not be destroyed until
    the QNearFieldManager destructor is called. Ownership may be transferred by calling
    setParent().

    Do not delete \a target from the slot connected to this signal, instead call deleteLater().

    \note that if \a target is deleted before it moves out of proximity the targetLost() signal
    will not be emitted.

    \sa targetLost()
*/

/*!
    \fn void QNearFieldManager::targetLost(QNearFieldTarget *target)

    This signal is emitted whenever a target moves out of proximity. The \a target parameter
    represents the lost target.

    Do not delete \a target from the slot connected to this signal, instead use deleteLater().
