\brief Notes on PC/SC support in Qt Nfc.

PC/SC support is provided using native APIs on macOS and Windows, and using
\l{https://pcsclite.apdu.fr/}{PCSCLite} library on other platforms. The API
can be used for accessing both wired and wireless smartcards and storage cards.

\section1 Limitations

\list
  \li The current API does not provide means to distinguish between separate
    readers/slots.
  \li NDEF access is only provided for NFC Type 4 tags.
  \li Other applications starting transactions on cards may block Qt applications
    from using Qt Nfc API.
  \li QNearFieldTarget::sendCommand() used with a PC/SC target starts
    a transaction that remains active until QNearFieldTarget::disconnect()
    is called. This transaction prevents other applications from accessing
    this target.
\endlist
