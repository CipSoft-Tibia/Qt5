\title Qt NFC
\brief Enables connectivity between NFC enabled devices.
\ingroup technology-apis

The NFC API provides connectivity between NFC enabled devices.

Currently, the API is supported on \l{Qt for Android}{Android} and \l{Qt for
iOS}{iOS}. This module also provides limited access to readers supporting
\l{PC/SC in Qt NFC}{PC/SC} specification on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

NFC is a short-range (less than 20 centimeters) wireless technology
with a maximum transfer rate of 424 Kbps. NFC is ideal for transferring
small packets of data when two devices are placed together.

The NFC module provides APIs for interacting with NFC Forum Tags and NFC Forum
Devices. It can detect targets and losses, register NDEF message handlers, read
and write NDEF messages on NFC Forum Tags, and send tag-specific commands.
