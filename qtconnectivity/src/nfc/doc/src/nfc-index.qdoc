\title Qt NFC
\brief Enables connectivity between NFC enabled devices.
\ingroup technology-apis

The NFC API provides connectivity between NFC enabled devices.

Currently the API is supported on \l{Qt for Android}{Android},
and \l{Qt for Linux/X11}{Linux} using \l {https://01.org/linux-nfc}{Neard} v0.14 or later.

\section1 Overview

NFC is an extremely short-range (less than 20 centimeters) wireless technology and has a
maximum transfer rate of 424 kbit/s. NFC is ideal for transferring small packets of data when two
devices are touched together.

The NFC API provides APIs for interacting with NFC Forum Tags and NFC Forum Devices, including
target detection and loss, registering NDEF message handlers, reading and writing NDEF messages
on NFC Forum Tags and sending tag specific commands.


\section1 Getting Started

To use the C++ library in your application, add the following configuration
option to your \c .pro file:

\snippet snippets.pro project modification

To use the classes of the module in your application you need the following
import statement in your \c .qml file:

\snippet doc_src_qtnfc.qml import

\section1 Licenses

Qt NFC is available under commercial licenses from \l{The Qt Company}.
In addition, it is available under free software licenses. Since Qt 5.4,
these free software licenses are
\l{GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3}, or
the \l{GNU General Public License, version 2}.
