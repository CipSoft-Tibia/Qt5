    \brief Migrate QtBluetooth to Qt 6.

    Qt 6 is a result of the conscious effort to make the framework more
    efficient and easy to use.

    We try to maintain binary and source compatibility for all the public
    APIs in each release. But some changes were inevitable in an effort to
    make Qt a better framework.

    In this topic we summarize those changes in QtBluetooth, and provide guidance
    to handle them.

    \section1 General

    \list
        \li qbluetoothglobal.h was removed. qtbluetoothglobal.h is the official header with the same purpose.

        \li Every usage of QVector has been replaced by QList.

        \li Win32 backend has been removed. There will not be a working Bluetooth backend when Qt is built with mingw.

        \li Since there is now only one Windows backend, the logging category qt.bluetooth.winrt was removed.
            The corresponding log messages are now in qt.bluetooth.windows.
    \endlist

    \section1 QBluetooth namespace

    The enums QBluetooth::Security and QBluetooth::AttAccessConstraint have been changed
    to a scoped enums for improved type safety.

    \section1 QBluetoothDeviceDiscoveryAgent

    QBluetoothDeviceDiscoveryAgent::inquiryType property and related setter/getter & enum were removed.
    The API element was never implemented and/or supported.

    \section1 QBluetoothDeviceInfo

    \list
        \li manufacturerData() returns a QMultiHash rather than QHash. Since Qt 6
            QMultiHash is no longer derived from QHash.

        \li DataCompleteness was removed without replacement as the related API elements
            no longer served a purpose

        \li setServiceUuids(const QList<QBluetoothUuid>, DataCompleteness) was replaced by
            setServiceUuids(const QList<QBluetoothUuid> &uuids)

        \li DataCompleteness serviceUuidsCompleteness() const was removed without replacement.

        \li QList<QBluetoothUuid> serviceUuids(DataCompleteness *completeness = nullptr) const was replaced by
            QList<QBluetoothUuid> serviceUuids() const.
    \endlist

    \section1 QBluetoothLocalDevice

    The pairing agent related API was removed without replacement. This includes pairingConfirmation(bool),
    pairingDisplayPinCode(..) & pairingDisplayConfirmation(..). Except for Android and BlueZ 4 there was
    never an implementation for it. Bluez 4 support was removed in Qt 6 and Android's implementation
    required unobtainable BLUETOOTH_PRIVILEGED for at least parts of the code.

    \section1 QLowEnergyService

    Renamed ServiceState enum values:
    \list
        \li \l{QLowEnergyService::DiscoveryRequired}{DiscoveryRequired}  becomes \l{QLowEnergyService::RemoteService}{RemoteService}
        \li \l{QLowEnergyService::DiscoveringService}{DiscoveringService} becomes \l{QLowEnergyService::RemoteServiceDiscovering}{RemoteServiceDiscovering}
        \li \l{QLowEnergyService::ServiceDiscovered}{ServiceDiscovered} becomes \l{QLowEnergyService::RemoteServiceDiscovered}{RemoteServiceDiscovered}
    \endlist
    This change happens in anticipation that service discovery might become an optional
    step in the future.

    \section1 QBluetoothUuid

    enums \l{QBluetoothUuid::ProtocolUuid}{ProtocolUuid},
    \l{QBluetoothUuid::ServiceClassUuid}{ServiceClassUuid},
    \l{QBluetoothUuid::CharacteristicType}{CharacteristicType}, and
    \l{QBluetoothUuid::DescriptorType}{DescriptorType} are now scoped enums.
    The usage of enum items has to be adapted in user code.

    \section1 QLowEnergyController

    \list
        \li Existing ctors and create*() functions with remote QBluetoothAddress parameters have been removed. QBluetoothAddress
            is not sufficient to indicate remote devices on Apple systems. It requires UUIDs to "name" devices. This can only
            be satisfied by QBluetoothDeviceInfo.

        \li Remaining QLowEnergyController ctors have been made private. The createPeripheral() and createCentral() functions
            should be used to obtain QLowEnergyController instances.
    \endlist

    \section1 QLowEnergyCharacteristic

    \list
        \li The new method clientCharacteristicConfiguration() has been introduced to conveniently obtain the
            Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor.
        \li The constants
            \l{QLowEnergyCharacteristic::CCCDDisable}{CCCDDisable},
            \l{QLowEnergyCharacteristic::CCCDEnableNotification}{CCCDEnableNotification}, and
            \l{QLowEnergyCharacteristic::CCCDEnableIndication}{CCCDEnableIndication} have been introduced
            which hold the possible values for the Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor.
        \li The handle() method is no longer part of the public Bluetooth LE interfaces. It's purpose as identifier
            for characteristics was replaced. The QLowEnergyCharacteristic instances itself serve as identifier.
    \endlist

    \section1 QLowEnergyDescriptor

    The handle() method is no longer part of the public Bluetooth LE interfaces. It's purpose as identifier
    for descriptors was replaced. The QLowEnergyDescriptor instances itself serve as identifier.

    \section1 QBluetoothTransferManager

    QBluetoothTransferManager, QBluetoothTransferRequest, and QBluetoothTransferReply have been removed
    without replacement.

    \section1 QBluetoothSocket

    QBluetoothSocket::SocketState and QBluetoothSocket::SocketError are now scoped enums. The usage of enum
    items has to be adapted in user code.

    \section1 QML Interface

    The QML interface has been removed because socket programming via QML is not advisable.
    QDeclarativeBluetoothService, QDeclarativeBluetoothSocket, and QDeclarativeBluetoothDiscoveryModel
    (in QML: BluetoothService, BluetoothSocket, and BluetoothDiscoveryModel)
    have been removed without replacement.

    \section1 "error" signals

    The "error" signals in QBluetoothDeviceDiscoveryAgent, QBluetoothLocalDevice, QBluetoothServer,
    QBluetoothServiceDiscoveryAgent, QBluetoothSocket, QLowEnergyController, and QLowEnergyService
    have been renamed to "errorOccurred" to remove ambiguities between the "error" signal and the
    "error" getter.
