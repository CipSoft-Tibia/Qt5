    \class QBluetoothLocalDevice
    \inmodule QtBluetooth
    \brief The QBluetoothLocalDevice class enables access to the local Bluetooth
    device.

    \since 5.2

    QBluetoothLocalDevice provides functions for getting and setting the state of local Bluetooth
    devices.

    On iOS and Windows, this class cannot be used because the platform does not expose
    any data or API which may provide information on the local Bluetooth device.
*/

/*!
    \enum QBluetoothLocalDevice::Pairing

    This enum describes the pairing state between the two Bluetooth devices.

    \value Unpaired         The Bluetooth devices are not paired.
    \value Paired           The Bluetooth devices are paired. The system will prompt the user for
                            authorization when the remote device initiates a connection to the
                            local device.
    \value AuthorizedPaired The Bluetooth devices are paired. The system will not prompt the user
                            for authorization when the remote device initiates a connection to the
                            local device.
*/

/*!
  \enum QBluetoothLocalDevice::Error

  This enum describes errors that maybe returned

  \value NoError        No known error
  \value PairingError   Error in pairing
  \value UnknownError   Unknown error

*/

/*!
    \enum QBluetoothLocalDevice::HostMode

    This enum describes the most of the local Bluetooth device.

    \value HostPoweredOff       Power off the device
    \value HostConnectable      Remote Bluetooth devices can connect to the local Bluetooth device
    if they have previously been paired with it or otherwise know its address. This powers up the
    device if it was powered off.
    \value HostDiscoverable     Remote Bluetooth devices can discover the presence of the local
    Bluetooth device. The device will also be connectable, and powered on. On Android, this mode can only be active
    for a maximum of 5 minutes.
    \value HostDiscoverableLimitedInquiry Remote Bluetooth devices can discover the presence of the local
     Bluetooth device when performing a limited inquiry. This should be used for locating services that are
     only made discoverable for a limited period of time. This can speed up discovery between gaming devices,
     as service discovery can be skipped on devices not in LimitedInquiry mode. In this mode, the device will
     be connectable and powered on, if required. This mode is is not supported on Android.
     On \macos, it is not possible to set the \l hostMode() to HostConnectable or HostPoweredOff.

    Sets the host mode of this local Bluetooth device to \a mode.

    \note Due to varying security policies on the supported platforms, this method may have
    differing behaviors on the various platforms. For example the system may ask the user for
    confirmation before turning Bluetooth on or off and not all host modes may be supported.
    On \macos, it is not possbile to programmatically change the \l hostMode().
    A user can only switch Bluetooth on/off in the System Preferences.
    Please refer to the platform specific Bluetooth documentation for details.
*/

/*!
    \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::HostMode QBluetoothLocalDevice::hostMode() const

    Returns the current host mode of this local Bluetooth device. On \macos, it is either
    HostPoweredOff or HostConnectable.
*/

/*!
    \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::name() const

    Returns the name assgined by the user to this Bluetooth device.
*/

/*!
    \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::address() const

    Returns the MAC address of this Bluetooth device.

    \note On Android, this function always returns the constant
    value \c {02:00:00:00:00:00} as local address starting with Android 6.0.
    The programmatic access to the device's local MAC address was removed.
*/

/*!

    Returns a list of all available local Bluetooth devices. On \macos, there is
    only the "default" local device.
*/

/*!
  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::powerOn()

  Powers on the device after returning it to the hostMode() state, if it was powered off.

  \note Due to varying security policies on the supported platforms, this method may have
  differing behaviors on the various platforms. For example
  the system may ask the user for confirmation before turning Bluetooth on or off.
  On \macos it is not possible to power on/off Bluetooth.
  Please refer to the platform specific Bluetooth documentation for details.

  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::QBluetoothLocalDevice(QObject *parent)

  The \a state of the host has transitioned to a different HostMode.

/*!
  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::deviceDisconnected(const QBluetoothAddress &address)

  with \a address.

  \sa deviceConnected(), connectedDevices()
*/

/*!
  \fn QList<QBluetoothAddress> QBluetoothLocalDevice::connectedDevices() const
  \since 5.3

  Returns the list of connected devices. This list is different from the list of currently
  paired devices.

  On Android and \macos, it is not possible to retrieve a list of connected devices. It is only possible to
  listen to (dis)connect changes. For convenience, this class monitors all connect
  and disconnect events since its instanciation and returns the current list when calling this function.
  Therefore it is possible that this function returns an empty list shortly after creating an
  instance.

  \sa deviceConnected(), deviceDisconnected()
*/

/*!
  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::pairingStatus(const QBluetoothAddress &address) const

  Returns the current bluetooth pairing status of \a address, if it's unpaired, paired, or paired and authorized.
*/

/*!
  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::pairingDisplayConfirmation(const QBluetoothAddress &address, QString pin)

  Signal by some platforms to display a pairing confirmation dialog for \a address.  The user
  is asked to confirm the \a pin is the same on both devices.  The \l pairingConfirmation() function
  must be called to indicate if the user accepts or rejects the displayed pin.

  This signal is only emitted for pairing requests issues by calling \l requestPairing().
  On \macos, this method never gets called - there is a callback with a PIN (IOBluetooth),
  but it expects immediate reply yes/no - and there is no time to show any dialog or compare PINs.

  \sa pairingConfirmation()
*/

/*!
  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::pairingConfirmation(bool confirmation)

  To be called after getting a pairingDisplayConfirmation(). The \a confirmation parameter either
  accepts the pairing or rejects it.

  Accepting a pairing always refers to the last pairing request issued via \l requestPairing().

  \note This function requires BLUETOOTH_PRIVILEGED permission on Android which is generally not
  obtainable for 3rdparty. Android's default handler for pairing requests will do this on behalf
  of the user and the application can ignore this call. Nevertheless the proper Android calls are made
  in case the application does have the required permissions.
*/

/*!
  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::pairingDisplayPinCode(const QBluetoothAddress &address, QString pin)

  Signal by some platforms to display the \a pin to the user for \a address.  The pin is automatically
  generated, and does not need to be confirmed.

  This signal is only emitted for pairing requests issues by calling \l requestPairing().
*/

/*!
  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::requestPairing(const QBluetoothAddress &address, Pairing pairing)

  Set the \a pairing status with \a address.  The results are returned by the signal, pairingFinished().
  On Android and \macos, AuthorizedPaired is not possible and will have the same behavior as Paired.

  On \macos, it is not possible to unpair a device. If Unpaired is requested, \l pairingFinished()
  is immediately emitted although the device remains paired. It is possible to request the pairing
  for a previously unpaired device. In addition \l AuthorizedPaired has the same behavior as \l Paired.

  Caution: creating a pairing may take minutes, and may require the user to acknowledge.
*/

/*!
  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::pairingFinished(const QBluetoothAddress &address, QBluetoothLocalDevice::Pairing pairing)

  Pairing or unpairing has completed with \a address. Current pairing status is in \a pairing.
  If the pairing request was not successful, this signal will not be emitted. The error() signal
  is emitted if the pairing request failed. The signal is only ever emitted for pairing requests
  which have previously requested by calling \l requestPairing() of the current object instance.
*/

/*!
  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::error(QBluetoothLocalDevice::Error error)
  Signal emitted if there's an exceptional \a error while pairing.
*/

/*!
  \fn QBluetoothLocalDevice::QBluetoothLocalDevice(const QBluetoothAddress &address, QObject *parent = 0)

  Construct new QBluetoothLocalDevice for \a address. If \a address is default constructed
  the resulting local device selects the local default device.
