    \class QBluetoothTransferManager
    \inmodule QtBluetooth
    \brief The QBluetoothTransferManager class transfers data to another device
    using Object Push Profile (OPP).

    \since 5.2

    QBluetoothTransferManager uses OBEX to send put commands to remote devices. A typical
    OBEX transfer is initialized as follows:

    \snippet doc_src_qtbluetooth.cpp sendfile

    Note that this API is not currently supported on Android.
*/

/*!
    \fn QBluetoothTransferReply *QBluetoothTransferManager::put(const QBluetoothTransferRequest &request, QIODevice *data)

    Sends the contents of \a data to the remote device identified by \a request, and returns a new
    QBluetoothTransferReply that can be used to track the request's progress. \a data must remain valid
    until the \l finished() signal is emitted.

    The returned \l QBluetoothTransferReply object must be immediately checked for its
    \l {QBluetoothTransferReply::error()}{error()} state. This is required in case
    this function detects an error during the initialization of the
    \l QBluetoothTransferReply. In such cases \l {QBluetoothTransferReply::isFinished()} returns
    \c true as well.

    If the platform does not support the Object Push profile, this function will return \c 0.
*/



/*!
    \fn void QBluetoothTransferManager::finished(QBluetoothTransferReply *reply)

    This signal is emitted when the transfer for \a reply finishes.
*/
