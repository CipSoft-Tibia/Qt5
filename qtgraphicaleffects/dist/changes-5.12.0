 - In Qt 5.12 and newer versions, this module is available with the same
   minor version as the Qt release minor version number. For example import
   QtGraphicalEffects 1.12 will work in Qt 5.12, even though there has been
   no API change, and the maximum possible import version will
   automatically increment in future Qt versions. This is intended to
   reduce confusion.
